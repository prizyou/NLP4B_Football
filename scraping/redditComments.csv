0,"The DFB hired the wrong coach if their goal was to bring back pragmatic, result orientated football"
1,"Imagine living in foreign country, then go to a match and whistle on your host team."
2,"This is by no means racist because I don’t gibe a crap about the nationality, but this pointless whistling we’ve seen from the turkish fanbases is the lowest shit Ive seen lol"
3,"Ngl, these whistles really are starting to grate on my nerves. Need more goals to shut them up."
4,"I'm kinda lacking the imaginative power to see us do ""well"" next year"
5,"The fact that there is not a single  german defender in Bayern’s starting lineup speaks volumes. Gone are the days of Boa , Lahm and Hummels , Ginter etc keeping it safe and quiet at the back. Bayern need to speed up and intensify development of some home grown defending talents if they don’t want to continue outsourcing expensive transfers from outside the league.
As for Dortmund idk wth is up with Sule and Schlotterbeck just standing like two giant easter island dummies . If Rudiger could just put in some serious work in his performances like he does in his aggressive animated theatrics it will do him very well in the long run."
6,"can turkish fans just shut the fuck up for one goddamn match, nobody enjoys your whistling"
7,Who is this Serge Gnabry guy and what did he do with Sergio Gnabinho
8,"Unless the Turkish players all get possessed by scarecrows and we end the game with a 9-3 win, any outcome of this is embarrassing. We’re letting Turkey put 3 past us in Berlin? Come on I know we’re shit but still"
9,"Not a good match by Sané, he looks bored"
10,"This German team is actually hopeless, not even a Klopp-Pep combo can save this generation"
11,"Why are they whistling like it’s the world cup final?

Chill out"
12,I'm just gonna mute every game where any Turkish team plays and sing/chant myself. I can't stand this whistling BS.
13,This isn’t even a home match for Germany lmao. The crowd is so one sided.
14,Ich hab genug gesehen. Dann lieber die alten Herren Müller und Hummels
15,"German freunde, what would you say is the problem here? This german generation of players are not that good, the coach?"
16,Man I’ve never really watched/supported my other NTs but if we lose against Austria I might have to take a break for the Euros
17,After this game and the Gala games they will be burning effigies of Sané in Istanbul lmao
18,"why is the stadium speaker guy sounding so excited that Turkey scored, like bruh it's ok to be biased for Germany here lmao"
19,"We will need an entire bus of therapists for our German national team players, if Germany plays like this in the group and gets knocked out."
20,"I was optimistic over and over again and I got disappointed over and over again. 

For now, I lost all hope that these guys can grow together as a team. They just don’t fit. 
Literally every player has been tested in all possible formations and tactics. We even tried „the best coaches“ we have. 

The puzzle just doesn’t solve. 
We have good players, not as good as one generation before, especially in the Defense which is horrific right now tbh, but midfield and attack has great potential, at least in theory. 
But it seems they can’t be formed as a working unit. 

Maybe we have to accept and wait until it gets better. Our gems Musiala and Wirtz still have over a decade left. Plenty of time to form a team around them."
21,Getting drowned out at a home game is really something ngl. Was similar in the Gala game at home a few weeks ago as well. Not German but it kinda pisses me off
22,Being a bird near a Turkish football stadium must be a very confusing experience
23,Whistling is lame. Lord Kai please shut them up
24,Never seen a team celebrate so much in s friendly..
25,Well this is embarrassing
26,Man these tactics are questionable at best. I know it's a friendly but there has been no adjustment at all since going down 3-2
27,Can someone tell that Turkish player he can ask for Wirtz jersey after the match and not strip him during it
28,Turkey literally winning every second ball. How is the german team so consistently shit since 2018?
29,"Again on Henrichs side.. This time he has to step further into the field though, because the CB's are out of position and that leaves the wing open."
30,"Havertz giveth, Havertz taketh"
31,That damn whistling
32,Chances for a draw were there
33,Turkey away is always tough
34,I'm not overreacting but where do we guys meet after the inevitable euro 2024 win?
35,"https://x.com/dfb_team/status/1725973603043229890?s=46

No way these fuckers posted sad pikachu"
36,"Not exactly playing good football, are we.."
37,Zeit für ein Lahm-Comeback
38,I thought we were past the Sané wing back stuff…
39,"What do you think of Rüdiger?

I find him so unlikable"
40,"What we saw here was a typical JN Bayern game Imo

Set up the team extremely well and start well, but the moment the opponent team adjusts he’s out of his depth. Reason why we threw so many games."
41,"Cant play with a 3/5 defense when you dont even have the players for it sane and kai dont know the position to play the defensive part whole game with discipline 
And henrichs is wasted as rcb .
When pressed high the offense doesnt drop far enough back and there is a big space between def and offense which forces long high balls and we dont have players who can shield the ball or win a header fülle a little but not nearly enough.
Gündogan kimmich pairing is bad because they are both weak defensive and get outbodied and outrun, if you play with 2 you need 1 who can win the ball back.
Quite a few more things but these are the big and important things."
42,HAVERTZ DEFENDING?  WHICH UNIVERSE IS THIS
43,![gif](giphy|texPPGdPu32q4)
44,"Wow what a goal that was a worldclass shot.
We have to stand up again and do sth"
45,There are 3 players on the pitch who think of defending. What are you cooking nagelsmann
46,"that shot almost looks like a Kane shot, wtf"
47,France is up 7-0 and Upa is still on the pitch btw
48,ugh Trapp had that
49,How is thst not a yellow for the turkish player?
50,I understand Nagelsmann is trying new things and want to give everyone a chance but instead he should probably settle for a team that works and this one obviously didn't. So close to the EM he basically should've already decided who is in the team and who is not.
51,I liked Sané in the first 20min but otherwise he is rather bad sadly
52,No Müller no party
53,Getting Galatasaray flashbacks with these Turkish supporters.
54,My god Sané is up to something today
55,"Nice moves there, Julian!"
56,What a fuckin pass. Holy shit
57,"Just tuned in to the game and as expected are the Turkish fans whistling like crazy!

Also almost no German fan to be seen lol"
58,I want Wirtz
59,"I like that JN is actually encouraging the German side to drop back and play on the counter when needed, not just mindless high line defence like Flick's and Löw's tactics"
60,"Wish Yildiz didn’t leave Bayern, especially on a free. He looks like he’s going to be a good player moving forward"
61,No ThoMats tax
62,"we'll surely come back and win this 3-2, relax boys"
63,This is not an enjoyable game
64,"Jesus, the playing out of the back is terrible..."
65,"I have a bad feeling that Upa and King will play the full 90 lmao

e: King is out!"
66,France 11-0 that's insane
67,That was pretty nice by Henrichs.
68,And so the cramps begin…
69,Getting Olé chants against you in your own stadium is kinda nuts man.. lmaooo. Germany are finished
70,Ref whistling every time a Turkish player throws himself to the ground..
71,I know a lot of people who are going to be absolutely insufferable about this loss for the next few years
72,Banger tackle by Henrichs
73,:D Turkey playing this game as if it is a world cup final.
74,Oh wow
75,ThoMats lmao
76,The last 15min were boring
77,Bro wanted a hug
78,"The German team is so weirdly bad in midfield, just a total loss of control most of the time when you have players like Gündogan, Wirtz, Kimmich and Brandt who should hypothetically be in control"
79,What I like about current Bayern is that we are really good in reacting to conceded goals. Both Germany team and previous Bayern (with Julian and early Tuchel) seems to collapsing right away.
80,"It feels like our midfield is actively waiting not to pass to Sané when he can make a run, only when he’s literally next to a defender they decide to pass. It’s so infuriating to watch, like what the fuck are you waiting for?"
81,what on earth was that by Yildiz
82,Somehow I expected this
83,"German commentary praising Groß again, but I don't understand why"
84,The amount of runs Sane makes that get wasted or played too late is mind blowing
85,This is such an ugly game. Not even talking about the game/passes/strategies but the way the players on both teams behave.
86,The insane number of handball pens is ruining the game
87,Trapp even guessed the right way....
88,7 minutes?? just call it a day man lmao
89,Yildiz was one of ours and could’ve been a german national fyi
90,Estoy cansado jefe
91,Can I be a NT plastic and just claim to be french? I just want to watch decent games in the international break again.
92,3 at the back strikes again. When will managers stop with this shit. We should have just stuck with Voller lol
93,Sané you are a nasty mf
94,Our best defender sane
95,Did they just bring on Jack Grealish
96,"fuck it, I'll get a ticket for an EM match of turkey and I'm booing these suckers for 90mins"
97,Yildiz....
98,bangers only
99,Bro....
100,Nagelsmann should be jailed for this starting line up..
101,Is Yildiz also that good in his club?
102,CHAD
103,i hope we have wirtz already secured
104,Back to winning the Euros baby
105,"No clue if Wirtz has any clause in his contract, but at this point the guy should not cost a single cent less than Bellingham if Leverkusen isn't dumb"
106,comms between Kimmich and Leroy kinda off right now
107,France is up 9:0 and Coman is the only one who scored more than once lol
108,"i think brandt would be such a baller if he was our player, but bvb pulls all players down"
109,I'm fine with this penalty. He wasn't in sprint excusing the arms moving excessively and he looked at him before he crossed in.
110,Damn Gnabry
111,How did he miss that
112,"You start havertz, you get sacked. It’s been the way since the inception of havertz. No manager is immune to havertz. Nagelsmann if he’s smart, will realise the curse before he gets the pink slip"
113,Imagine telling someone a year ago that Havertz would be Germany’s best defender
114,Gundo is a criminal for not returning that pass on the wing. That was a full on counter waiting to happen
115,Sané looks completely checked out
116,Interested to see how Havertz works out as L(W)B
117,Turks and their whistling..
118,SANÉ! Thought he scores/shots himself
119,Whistle that lol
120,I like Henrichs so far
121,That pass by Kimmich wow
122,Ahhhh shit. That was a good shot tbf
123,"Damn, that was something and a half."
124,wtf
125,I mean his hand is in a natural position idk
126,my left back
127,Which pikachu gif are we using now?
128,ok right
129,[deleted]
130,These cutting passes by Kimmich and Gundo are orgasmic
131,"Deschamps, my man, what about subbing Upa and Coman"
132,Where was right back?
133,I honestly think we won't get Wirtz. He will be way too expensive.
134,"This team is a joke, we will get embarassed in the euros at home."
135,Wonder what playing against Turkey must feel like for Gündo right now.
136,Best LB in the world !!!
137,just put 100 on the table for wirtz
138,"Sane has to be a bit more selfish again, sometimes he could do it himself but he seems scared.
Hes still a worldclass player rn"
139,We should have played with the 1996 kits tonight the guys were wearing them before the game
140,Someone shoot plz 💀
141,Damn
142,Lückeee
143,Come on Gündo. Just kicked it straight at the defender in front of him lol
144,Uh oh... Smells like a harsh pen
145,Ffs
146,Tah should play as RB and Hummels next to Rüdiger
147,That's 100% a penalty
148,I dont know if Müller on the bench will ever feel right
149,Kimmich has been so good
150,Ref that's not a pen...
151,\^gnabry how on earth do you not go with your left foot first
152,what even was henrichs doing? is he not the RB
153,"Gnabry has been Thunderstruck, we gotta find the white boy that got his power"
154,"Still think Germany has a better chance of winning the euros than England, for example."
155,"Suggesting that 3 at the back is a good idea with this squad is a sackable offence. It just shows such an awful lack of tactical awareness, historic source digestion and creativity. It’s like suggesting we don’t play with a goalkeeper or putting Havertz in defence."
156,I feel much more comfortable with Trapp in goal than Hair Stegen
157,What position is havertz playing
158,"Hansi Flick wasn't the problem, but he definitely had too much trust in Kimmich and should have done more to keep Kroos.

My opinion keeping player like Hummels, Boateng, and Muller away from the team after 2018 really hurt the identity of the team. I actually think that the 35 Yr olds Hummels and Boateng would be a better pair than anything we have seen so far, obviously never going to happen. This group can still win the Euros but it will have to come from an entire overhall within german football. The question is can Nagelsmann be the one to orchestrate this change."
159,not ready to watch havertz play
160,let Naggy cook
161,tersetegen with the ball is a horrorshow
162,How can we watch in the US? I cannot not find it
163,Come on then let’s see how it goes. Bizarre lineup but Nanglesmann has got the big calls right thus far!
164,ok ok
165,Lesgoooo
166,"Credit where credit is due, that was nice!"
167,That was bad by gündo
168,nice
169,"What do all these managers see in Havertz really? Like... why do so many want to die on this hill out of all hills? 

I really thought Nagelsmann would be pragmatic but he just can't help himself can he?"
0,"1. A lot of people had problems with his attitude when he was playing. He always seemed like he was lacking motivation. 

2. Made the famous pic with Erdogan. While Gundogan apologized for taking it, Ozil called everyone who criticized him for it a racist and islamophobic. 

3. Had Erdogan as his best man at his wedding

4. As a tattoo with a symbol of the grey wolves. They’re a nationalistic, racist and far right organization. 

Ozil as a player was class, as a human being he’s not so great I guess"
1,"Read the newest Interview with his father, he is talking what the big problem with his career was. Got every opportunity in Germany and was the poster child about good integration, but called a dictator his president as german. After critics, tried the racism card and now has turkish right wing tatoos.  


Good player, bad workrate and really dumb."
2,He has a tatoo of a Turkish far-right organization.
3,absolutely incredible player who then downed tools for years and has dodgy political views and affiliations
4,Supported a man that people really didn't like much
5,"didn't know about it too, saw him talking shit about Zinchenko the other day, guy is hella vocal about politics it usually come with a lot of hate"
6,"Im Turkish. We don't like him because

1)Choosed Germany and said that he feels German

2)nothing wrong with that, but after Germany kicked him out he became a super turkish nationalist erdogan fanboy

3)literally said he is a fan of AKP(Erdogans party) propaganda tv shows

4)played like shit in Fenerbahce

5)played in Fenerbahce

6)played in Basaksehir(Erdogan pet project footbal team)"
7,"1. Accused of being lazy 
2. Made a post calling out China for their treatment of the local Muslim population. Arsenal didn’t have his back and the fans called him “political” 
3. Open “support” of Erdogan. 
4. Accused the DFB of Islamophobia 
5. Refused to cut his wages during the pandemic 

I like Ozil and think that some of these accusations lack context and are circunstancial at best. Football Iconic made a really great video about Ozil that I highly recommend

https://youtu.be/8dIQ56YACvE?si=fgADRHdiCkqG387P"
8,I remember when Germany played against turkey on a Wednesday. He was injured allegedly. But then at the next Saturday he played again for Real Madrid. He is the most opportunistic player ever.
9,"Supported a dictator. Called him “My President”.

He wasn’t really a revolutionary player. A classic playmaker that lacked consistency to be considered one of the true greats."
10,Got a tattoo of a facist organisation
11,His political ideology doesn’t align with the Westerners.
12,"Political matters. Had a picture with the Turkish president 2 months before the 2018 World Cup , where Germany as a whole messed up the entire tournament , and got blamed for the disaster. Then expressed his support to Uyghur Turks which leaves Chinese under blame , who had a huge chunk of stocks at Arsenal, which ruined it entirely for him"
13,"People don’t like him because of his political opinions as they act like they’re experts in Turkish politics. 

As a player I can agree people would consider his mentality weak or unprofessional"
14,"Had a close relationship with Turkish president (dictator) Erdoğan, supported a far right Turkish terrorist group, acted like a Turkish nationalist but refused to join Turkish National team and he lied about it saying he wasnt invited to the Turkish National team, also accused his german teammates of racism, when he arrived at Turkey he was really underwhelming at Fenerbahçe then ended his career at Istanbul Başakşehir (A team that is owned by president Erdoğan and his far right buddies)"
15,He advocated for muslims in Uyghur. And you know how the prem is. If you support a blue eyed and blond haired human being you’re good but how dare you support a muslim terrorist right?
16,I mean Germany does have a history of racism and discrimination.
17,Never moved faster than a light jog and couldn't tackle
18,"In terms of being underrated on the pitch, just his casual and undemonstrative body language. Everything was so elegant he made it look simple and easy, whereas someone like Connor Gallagher steams around crashing into people and cant pass it ten yards but is lauded as a team player.

In terms of hatred almost certainly rooted in Racism and Islamaphobia. He famoulsy said when i win Im German when i lose im Turkish. He called out the inhumane treatment or Uighur Mulsims in China when Arsenal did a promotional tour there which was the end of that relationship.

He is a great footballer and human, among the most philanthropic out there."
19,The moment he showed his Muslim identity he became public enemy for the bigots and Islamophobes. Including Arsenal reprimanding him for speaking out against the plight of the Uighurs at the hands of the Chinese government.
20,"He was honest about his political beliefs unlike almost every other footballer and got hatred for not apologising like Gundo did. 

He also had a ‘lazy’ play style that is a lightning rod for criticism unless you’re winning every game."
21,"People are soft and dont really understand people nor politics, easily triggered, misinformed etc.. also not to mention the whole turks in germany situation, incompatible cultures and all that. It really doesnt matter, Ozil is one of the most attractive mids that ever played, i enjoyed every minute of his field time. Long live Ozil!"
22,He spoke facts.
23,He called out China for the uigher issue..China buys and sponsors alot of arsenals stuff.
24,"he didnt had the mental capacity to overcome racist slurs he was facing. dunno why he didnt turn to some professional support etc. to overcome it and then had some faux pas like the erdogan pic for what he got critics but combined with the racial/german turkophobia it was a grossly exaggerated reaction from german medias/germany overall. now they had a reason to be dismissive and hateful. it was justified now and didnt need any implications or between the lines to slur him. and imo he lost the overview and instead on focusing what he had he tried to compensate it with turkeypholia aka ""now more than ever"" because his homeland kinda didnt feel home-ish. latest downfall is his grey wolf tattoo. they are a turkish right-wing extremist movement. he is a grown man and is responsible for it by himself. but imo it is pretty sure that the systematic german turkophoby gave him the kick in that direction. ""OG germans dont like it when (turkish) migrants sit at the same table with them. they are used migrants/deutschtürken stay on the floor"" is what a migration researcher once said. now obviously there is (more) change but during özil s rise it was more than ever present. it was that generation that didnt depend/want depend/needed to depend on low income jobs like their parents/grandparents. gündogan is an example that overcame that system. i am more than sure he had to suck up a lot of german bullshit in order to stay where he is now. özil on the other hand is now just a shallow shell of turkish propaganda. That's there so low profile germany football ""analysts"" can dismisse his past influence and success.
to say how exagerated german media was on özil. neuer once sang a croatian nazi song during his croatia holiday. 0 consequences or public apologies. gundogan didnt only apologize he had to openly prove ""his loyalty to germany"". özil didnt want to bow too low and tried to explain it."
25,Germans are S tier racists and don't consider anyone who is not white as germans. They have learnt to hide their true self but sometimes they show their true colours.
26,"Being lazy on the pitch. And it’s not a myth either. There are numerous examples from highlights alone where you can pin at least a portion of the blame on Ozil for not bothering to track back or just dangling out a lazy leg. 

The Bayern thrashings were the perfect example of this. One or two goals where he lets Robben come inside, drift past him, then just jogs back at a snail’s pace."
27,He reminds me of Berbatov.  Amazing skills but seemingly no effort.  Some of his assists were crazy good.
28,"Yeah he wasn't the most professional, plus he's been controversial on his political views. It's a shame, because talent-wise he's definitely one of my favorite players. I don't care much for Real Madrid but I got an Özil jersey just because I was fascinated with him."
29,I felt he was very lazy.
30,"As a player from my understanding, his downfall at Arsenal was people wanted him to track back but he never did that in Germany or Madrid. 

People dislike his politics"
31,It was so disappointing
32,He's the antisemitic bream.
33,Because Germans are extremely racist.
34,Openly supporting any right-wing politician = cancelled. That’s all you need to know.
35,"He acted like a man child at Arsenal aswell. Managed to turn the narrative on his side that the only issue Arsenal had with him is the Uighur stuff. That was a shit move from our club but he had massive issues here prior. He was a big reason Emery got sacked because Emery hated his attitude and began benching him, but Ozil turned the squad against him instead.

Freddie also openly criticised him and Arteta also became fed up with his attitude in the end and finally cast him out. He sat on a monstrous contract he wasn’t justifying and was a big part of our shit locker room mentality but he always had god tier PR that made him look the victim no matter what."
36,Nice guy until he posed with Erdoghan and turned fascist
37,Nobody hates him all at all. Calling out an over rated player is not hate
38,"I understand people may not like him as a person but just like with actors I kinda like to stick to what they do as a professional, he's a football player you either like him on the pitch or you don't  


Idc who their best friends are or their political opinions"
39,"Man just stopped playing football at a semi-decent level... He could've done so much more but wasted his time and picked up his wages... Him and Hazard... Both were EXCELLENT players, don't get it twisted... Could say the same for Bale... Just coasting, picking up money and offering very little"
40,he preferred to act like a German during his early career and prime time and then decided to act like a Turkish when he got old/ his career started to decline. This is because he knew that he would benefit from being German in his very first years (German national team is far superior)  and then he was acting like he rememberred who he actually was.
41,Outwardly support an absolute right wing nut job politician.
42,He is just a scumbag
43,"I think you should look up the definition of revolutionary.  He was good at his best, but he didn't change the way the game was played."
44,"A superb athlete loses all motivation upon achieving quite a lot to be fair. Mou read it early enough to boot him to Arsenal where he somewhat revitalized his ambition but petered out quickly. Also, his nonchalant body language was viewed by fans as a sign of not caring enough for the game and the team. Similarly, Berbatov and Arshavin were hated for their ""laziness"". But there is a room for players with this approach to the game and it is exactly why they find time and space to find that killer pass or a flick of a ball to leave the opponents frozen. On top of that you have your political and societal bullshit that only takes away from athletes than anything else."
45,That stupid Axel F song.
46,His entire career was based on a four week decent bit of form at the world cup
47,Well it’s more the fact he exists really
