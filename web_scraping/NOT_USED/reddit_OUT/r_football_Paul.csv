5,football,Why is the German national team so weak?,"# In this post, let's discuss the root causes and factors of the weakness of the German national team, and enjoy the journey to Germany's return to power.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, it is my personal opinion that defense is the most important thing in modern football.

Therefore, although it has been pointed out that the German national team lacks forwards and strikers and has a low scoring ability, this is a problem, but I disagree.

As is clear from today's match against Turkey, the German national team loses games by conceding more goals than the team's scoring ability.

Argentina's strength in winning the Qatar World Cup.

And the reason for the strength of Argentina, which is ranked 1st in the World Cup 2026 qualifying.

This is due to their high defensive strength, as Argentina concedes very few goals.

The only time we conceded was two goals against Uruguay.

This is tied for best among CONMEBOL World Cup 2026 Qualifiers.

Currently, there is not a single decent defender among German football players.

Therefore, in order for the German national team to make a comeback, it is urgently necessary to develop defenders.

The German national team will continue to lose in official games until they improve their collapsing defense.",0.69,23,0,23
6,football,Apart from Messi who do you think is the greatest ever dribbler,"Obviously most people think of him first but there is definitely a few players who come very close, for example Neymar, Zidane, ronaldinho, Ronaldo (Nazario), etc.",0.75,106,0,106
7,football,The large number of weak teams in Europe calls for a preliminary qualifying round.,"There are teams in Europe that will almost never make it to any tournament‚Ä¶all they do is make the numbers and thus increase the number of games competitive countries have to play. 

In Asia and Africa, they already have different stages of qualification, although it‚Äôs a different setup to what I think Europe needs. 

My take is the countries with the lowest FIFA ratings should play a two-legged knockout fixture (or a one-off could be a better idea) and then proceed to the main qualifying round. 

What‚Äôs your take on that?",0.62,11,0,11
8,football,My friend said Chelsea Hazard was better than all Madrid players except Ronaldo during Three peat,Is he delusional?,0.36,0,0,0
9,football,Germany's era in football is over for good,"Turkey lost to Japan 4-2, and Germany lost 3-2 to Turkey.

It's so strange that such a weak Germany is ranked 15th in FIFA.

Germany has become a middle-ranked country both in name and reality.

Japan dealt the final blow to Germany.

Germans should come to Japan to learn football.

Germans should study football in Japan's J League.

The Germans will never be able to beat Japan in football again.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

By the way, don't forget the fact that Japan won a comfortable 4-2 victory over Turkey with the second team, the B team, rather than the best members.

The German national team went into the match with an unusual strategy of using Havertz as the left back in a 4-2-2-2, but there is no doubt that they had the best squad, so there is no excuse.",0.42,0,0,0
10,football,I think I am starting to hate 'International Breaks',"The rhythm of the season just get's broken up some how. My Saturday habits are put on hold for national glory(\\s). Maybe watching a game, following the goal reports, he soothing monotony of Final Score, Match of the Day ....all just gone.

Surely it is one of the levelers of the game. If you are a big enough club to have international class players, in the past you had to accept that those players would be missing for part of the season. You have a big enough squad, manage around it. Chance for the lower reaches of the table to make up some ground. Chance for some youngsters to get first team experience.

I think I was only dominantly right footed only for around a year or two as I mostly remember using my left foot a lot more than my right. And that‚Äôs the case now, I always use my left for shooting, crossing and passing etc. 

However, I will naturally go onto my right foot for dribbling and taking a first touch and most skills, in which I have far better control with.

2018-2019: Probably the best for me; Liverpool''s tight escape from the group stage and then the Anfield comeback. Tottenham's tie with City and then coming back against Ajax. Ajax devouring Real fearlessly. Only thing weak was that boring final.


2009-2010: This one had absolute bangers; Man Utd vs Milan and Man Utd vs Bayern were the absolute standouts. Inter's journey was pretty badass as well, especially against Barcelona. Seeing Jose eating Pep like that was pretty special.


2011-2012: Chelsea's journey was even more badass considering they were in such a messy season. Also, Bayern somehow knocking out one of the greatest Real sides to ever exist. And Chelsea dispatching Messi in his best year. Plus, the final was amazing.

2021-2022: I would include this one because it was hilarious; Ancelotti dropping his eyebrow and his side would automatically pull the most unlikely comeback to ever exist. Also, Villareal's deep run was pretty amazing, absolute giant slayers.

2003-2004: This one, I admit that I was to young to remember but damn!! Porto and Deportivo knocking out those absolute monster squads that Man Utd and Milan had.

So even when team A batters team B, hits the post eight times and then concedes a last minute deflected winner, they weren‚Äôt unlucky, but Team B had a better mentality, or Team A‚Äôs manager always bottles things in Europe so this was inevitable, or it was actually the genius of dropping player X into a false 9 rather than playing a traditional striker that made the difference.

82,football,my alternative scenario for the transfers during the first Gal√°cticos era at Real Madrid from 2002 to 2006,"the main issue on the transfers during the first Gal√°cticos era at Real Madrid between 2002 and February 2006 (when Florentino Perez resigned) was the lack of balance; too many attacking outlets and little-to-no defensive transfers. if I was Perez at that time, I would do it a bit differently, balancing between attacking and defensive, and also between popularity and necessity. here is how I would do it.

1. **Summer transfer window 2002**:

CB option 1: Fabio Cannavaro, Italy, age 28 at that time, from Parma (yes, long before his actual transfer in 2006)\^  
CB option 2: Alessandro Nesta, Italy, age 26 at that time, from Lazio\^  
CB option 3: instead of Woodgate (which came in 2004), I would suggest a bolder option, which is Rio Ferdinand. an English, age 23 at that time, from Leeds United\^  
CF, Ronaldo Nazario, Brazil, age 25 at that time, from Inter Milan (actual transfer)

\^not all options had to be bought, at most two in each position

2. **Summer transfer window 2003**:  
DM option 1: Patrick Vieira, France, age 27 at that time, from Arsenal\^  
DM option 2: Massimo Ambrosini, Italy, age 26 at that time, from AC Milan (would be quite sensible, because he faced tough competition against Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso and Cristian Brocchi in AC Milan)\^  
DM option 3: Emerson, Brazil, age 27 at that time, from AS Roma (long before his actual transfer in 2006, which I think was a bit too late)\^  
CB option 1: Gabriel Milito, Argentina, age 22 at that time, from Independiente (almost became reality, but he did not pass the medical test due to injury)\^  
RM, David Beckham, England, age 28 at that time, from Manchester United (actual transfer, but I partially disagree because of the redundancy)

\^not all options had to be bought, at most two in each position

3. **Summer transfer window 2004**:

\*CF, Michael Owen, England, age 24 at that time, from Liverpool (again, this is the actual transfer; without the weird ""having-to-play superstars"" policy, he would have got more playing chances, especially when Ronaldo Nazario got injured while also having weight issues, and stayed in Madrid for a bit longer)

\*no need for other transfers like Walter Samuel, Jonathan Woodgate and Thomas Gravesen, because, according to this scenario, we already brought defensive transfers for the past two years. up until this part, unlike in real life, the team would be a bit more balanced with at least one more true defensive-minded midfielder.

Let's compare the line-up of the Clasico on 20 November 2004 to the hypothetical version according to this scenario:

Actual:

GK: Iker Casillas  
DF: Francisco Pavon, Walter Samuel, Michel Salgado, Roberto Carlos  
MF: Guti, David Beckham, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane  
FW: Raul Gonzalez (SS), Ronaldo Nazario (CF)

Hypothetical:

GK: Iker Casillas  
DF: Alessandro Nesta, Francisco Pavon, Michel Salgado, Roberto Carlos  
MF: Patrick Vieira, Massimo Ambrosini, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane  
FW: Raul Gonzalez (SS), Ronaldo Nazario (CF)

as can be seen, on-paper it looks a bit more balanced between attack and defense. in real life, from 2003 to 2006, they did not get any silverware (mainly due to the imbalanced squad), but with my suggested alternative signings, I think they could be a bit more fortunate.

4. **Summer transfer window 2005**: I mostly agree with their 2005-06 signings, except for maybe two Uruguayans Diogo Ense√±at and Pablo Garcia. although I would have added one more player for the full-back positions:

LB, Ashley Cole, England, age 24 at that time, from Arsenal (one year after the invincible season, he could be a back-up and ""future"" replacement for Roberto Carlos, especially when the Madrid board had not considered Marcelo at that time)

for the right-back position (to back-up Michel Salgado), they already brought Sergio Ramos, but in case they did not, I would have suggested Philipp Lahm, a 21-year-old from Germany and Bayern Munchen.",0.5,0,0,0
83,football,Serious Question: Why is the Premier League much better at dealing with Discrimination/Racism than La Liga?,"Hey guys,

Talking with many people and doing my own research I have come to this conclusion. For instance, I've read about player who went to the Premier League and were not called by any ""Racially charged"" nickname by their fellow players. Something had to go  through on other leagues especially La Liga. 

To me this is ""Common Sense"" and I don't believe the ""term of endearment"" argument that some people put forth, usually closet racists. Since ethnic identification should be more of ""private matter"" and has nothing to do with  football or work collegues or friends on the pitch. For instance,if I had a friend from a different ethnic group I don't think it should be up to me to start giving him nicknames based on his ethnicity; To me that's crossing the line. 

I've also heard the Premier League fans at the stadium behave better than the La Liga. I seen videos of how  Spaniards behave towards players from  minority groups. They'll shout all kinds of racial slurs. It seems to be a extremely hostile environment. 

The three main objections that Spaniards and the Directors of Spanish Football put forth are:

1-**Fatalism**: Nothing can be done. Spanish Society is Racist, Football its Racist, The World is Racist. I'm not buying it if this was the case, then how are Brits able to do something about it?

**2-Empathy towards the evil doer and not the victims:** I've seen this with Spaniards but also with Argentinians. Like,'Oh those poor working class people, they don't know any better."" If you start giving them fines you'll be doing them a great harm since they don't have much money' I heard some Spaniards say, ""Vinicius and other minority players are rich they need to get over it.""

**3-It would be too expensive:** Some people say that if they start implementing these reforms it would be too expensive and they would lose fans.

What do you guys think? How was the Premier League able to overcome these objections?",0.55,5,0,5

Within that time he‚Äôs broken into the first team under Lampard with other cobham graduates. Many Chelsea fans would probably agree that this was a very fun and likeable team, a weird season where we had a transfer ban and lost Hazard. Pure Vibes, whatever happens, happens. No one knew what was gonna happen that season but we pipped top 4 with the likes of Tammy, Mount, Tomori and Reece. Under club Legend Lampard, this seemed like a fairytale with Mount as the main character.

Fast forward, he has won back to back Chelsea player of the year awards after joining a prestigious list of Chelsea players that managed to get 10+ Goals and 10+ assists in a season. He played week in week out during these years and also has the CL Final assist under his belt as well and every manager he played under loved him. Before this season he was a regular England squad member. Was seen as one of the best young players around.

What happened?

Terrible terrible season last year yet Mount had done more than enough for Chelsea for many fans to be understandably upset when it seemed like he was about to join United. This was Chelsea‚Äôs poster boy, at the club since he was a child‚Ä¶He get‚Äôs sold for ¬£65m. Before the season, many said United now had one of the best midfields in the league, Mount, Bruno, Casemiro yet you probably won‚Äôt find many saying the same thing right now.

United have had a what seems to be, shaky start to the season yet only find themselves 1 spot out of Europe. Mount‚Äôs been injured for parts of it but even when he‚Äôs played has looked tired, just like last season. Not in the England squad and currently benched for United.

Football is heavily subjected to recency bias. Chelsea with strong results against Spurs and City‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt think many Chelsea fans would have Mount back in the team. For who? Midfield looks great, Sterling is playing well and Chelsea fans seem to particularly like Palmer. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any regret in selling him?

105,football,Why is the German national team so weak?,"# In this post, let's discuss the root causes and factors of the weakness of the German national team, and enjoy the journey to Germany's return to power.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, it is my personal opinion that defense is the most important thing in modern football.

Therefore, although it has been pointed out that the German national team lacks forwards and strikers and has a low scoring ability, this is a problem, but I disagree.

As is clear from today's match against Turkey, the German national team loses games by conceding more goals than the team's scoring ability.

Argentina's strength in winning the Qatar World Cup.

And the reason for the strength of Argentina, which is ranked 1st in the World Cup 2026 qualifying.

This is due to their high defensive strength, as Argentina concedes very few goals.

The only time we conceded was two goals against Uruguay.

This is tied for best among CONMEBOL World Cup 2026 Qualifiers.

Currently, there is not a single decent defender among German football players.

Therefore, in order for the German national team to make a comeback, it is urgently necessary to develop defenders.

The German national team will continue to lose in official games until they improve their collapsing defense.",0.7,25,0,25
106,football,Apart from Messi who do you think is the greatest ever dribbler,"Obviously most people think of him first but there is definitely a few players who come very close, for example Neymar, Zidane, ronaldinho, Ronaldo (Nazario), etc.",0.75,107,0,107
107,football,The large number of weak teams in Europe calls for a preliminary qualifying round.,"There are teams in Europe that will almost never make it to any tournament‚Ä¶all they do is make the numbers and thus increase the number of games competitive countries have to play. 

In Asia and Africa, they already have different stages of qualification, although it‚Äôs a different setup to what I think Europe needs. 

My take is the countries with the lowest FIFA ratings should play a two-legged knockout fixture (or a one-off could be a better idea) and then proceed to the main qualifying round. 

What‚Äôs your take on that?",0.64,13,0,13

109,football,Germany's era in football is over for good,"Turkey lost to Japan 4-2, and Germany lost 3-2 to Turkey.

It's so strange that such a weak Germany is ranked 15th in FIFA.

Germany has become a middle-ranked country both in name and reality.

Japan dealt the final blow to Germany.

Germans should come to Japan to learn football.

Germans should study football in Japan's J League.

The Germans will never be able to beat Japan in football again.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

By the way, don't forget the fact that Japan won a comfortable 4-2 victory over Turkey with the second team, the B team, rather than the best members.

The German national team went into the match with an unusual strategy of using Havertz as the left back in a 4-2-2-2, but there is no doubt that they had the best squad, so there is no excuse.",0.42,0,0,0
110,football,I think I am starting to hate 'International Breaks',"The rhythm of the season just get's broken up some how. My Saturday habits are put on hold for national glory(\\s). Maybe watching a game, following the goal reports, he soothing monotony of Final Score, Match of the Day ....all just gone.

Surely it is one of the levelers of the game. If you are a big enough club to have international class players, in the past you had to accept that those players would be missing for part of the season. You have a big enough squad, manage around it. Chance for the lower reaches of the table to make up some ground. Chance for some youngsters to get first team experience.

However, I will naturally go onto my right foot for dribbling and taking a first touch and most skills, in which I have far better control with.

2009-2010: This one had absolute bangers; Man Utd vs Milan and Man Utd vs Bayern were the absolute standouts. Inter's journey was pretty badass as well, especially against Barcelona. Seeing Jose eating Pep like that was pretty special.


2011-2012: Chelsea's journey was even more badass considering they were in such a messy season. Also, Bayern somehow knocking out one of the greatest Real sides to ever exist. And Chelsea dispatching Messi in his best year. Plus, the final was amazing.

2021-2022: I would include this one because it was hilarious; Ancelotti dropping his eyebrow and his side would automatically pull the most unlikely comeback to ever exist. Also, Villareal's deep run was pretty amazing, absolute giant slayers.

2003-2004: This one, I admit that I was to young to remember but damn!! Porto and Deportivo knocking out those absolute monster squads that Man Utd and Milan had.

182,football,my alternative scenario for the transfers during the first Gal√°cticos era at Real Madrid from 2002 to 2006,"the main issue on the transfers during the first Gal√°cticos era at Real Madrid between 2002 and February 2006 (when Florentino Perez resigned) was the lack of balance; too many attacking outlets and little-to-no defensive transfers. if I was Perez at that time, I would do it a bit differently, balancing between attacking and defensive, and also between popularity and necessity. here is how I would do it.

1. **Summer transfer window 2002**:

CB option 1: Fabio Cannavaro, Italy, age 28 at that time, from Parma (yes, long before his actual transfer in 2006)\^  
CB option 2: Alessandro Nesta, Italy, age 26 at that time, from Lazio\^  
CB option 3: instead of Woodgate (which came in 2004), I would suggest a bolder option, which is Rio Ferdinand. an English, age 23 at that time, from Leeds United\^  
CF, Ronaldo Nazario, Brazil, age 25 at that time, from Inter Milan (actual transfer)

\^not all options had to be bought, at most two in each position

2. **Summer transfer window 2003**:  
DM option 1: Patrick Vieira, France, age 27 at that time, from Arsenal\^  
DM option 2: Massimo Ambrosini, Italy, age 26 at that time, from AC Milan (would be quite sensible, because he faced tough competition against Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso and Cristian Brocchi in AC Milan)\^  
DM option 3: Emerson, Brazil, age 27 at that time, from AS Roma (long before his actual transfer in 2006, which I think was a bit too late)\^  
CB option 1: Gabriel Milito, Argentina, age 22 at that time, from Independiente (almost became reality, but he did not pass the medical test due to injury)\^  
RM, David Beckham, England, age 28 at that time, from Manchester United (actual transfer, but I partially disagree because of the redundancy)

\^not all options had to be bought, at most two in each position

3. **Summer transfer window 2004**:

\*CF, Michael Owen, England, age 24 at that time, from Liverpool (again, this is the actual transfer; without the weird ""having-to-play superstars"" policy, he would have got more playing chances, especially when Ronaldo Nazario got injured while also having weight issues, and stayed in Madrid for a bit longer)

\*no need for other transfers like Walter Samuel, Jonathan Woodgate and Thomas Gravesen, because, according to this scenario, we already brought defensive transfers for the past two years. up until this part, unlike in real life, the team would be a bit more balanced with at least one more true defensive-minded midfielder.

Let's compare the line-up of the Clasico on 20 November 2004 to the hypothetical version according to this scenario:

Actual:

GK: Iker Casillas  
DF: Francisco Pavon, Walter Samuel, Michel Salgado, Roberto Carlos  
MF: Guti, David Beckham, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane  
FW: Raul Gonzalez (SS), Ronaldo Nazario (CF)

Hypothetical:

GK: Iker Casillas  
DF: Alessandro Nesta, Francisco Pavon, Michel Salgado, Roberto Carlos  
MF: Patrick Vieira, Massimo Ambrosini, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane  
FW: Raul Gonzalez (SS), Ronaldo Nazario (CF)

as can be seen, on-paper it looks a bit more balanced between attack and defense. in real life, from 2003 to 2006, they did not get any silverware (mainly due to the imbalanced squad), but with my suggested alternative signings, I think they could be a bit more fortunate.

4. **Summer transfer window 2005**: I mostly agree with their 2005-06 signings, except for maybe two Uruguayans Diogo Ense√±at and Pablo Garcia. although I would have added one more player for the full-back positions:

LB, Ashley Cole, England, age 24 at that time, from Arsenal (one year after the invincible season, he could be a back-up and ""future"" replacement for Roberto Carlos, especially when the Madrid board had not considered Marcelo at that time)

for the right-back position (to back-up Michel Salgado), they already brought Sergio Ramos, but in case they did not, I would have suggested Philipp Lahm, a 21-year-old from Germany and Bayern Munchen.",0.5,0,0,0
183,football,Serious Question: Why is the Premier League much better at dealing with Discrimination/Racism than La Liga?,"Hey guys,

Talking with many people and doing my own research I have come to this conclusion. For instance, I've read about player who went to the Premier League and were not called by any ""Racially charged"" nickname by their fellow players. Something had to go  through on other leagues especially La Liga. 

To me this is ""Common Sense"" and I don't believe the ""term of endearment"" argument that some people put forth, usually closet racists. Since ethnic identification should be more of ""private matter"" and has nothing to do with  football or work collegues or friends on the pitch. For instance,if I had a friend from a different ethnic group I don't think it should be up to me to start giving him nicknames based on his ethnicity; To me that's crossing the line. 

I've also heard the Premier League fans at the stadium behave better than the La Liga. I seen videos of how  Spaniards behave towards players from  minority groups. They'll shout all kinds of racial slurs. It seems to be a extremely hostile environment. 

The three main objections that Spaniards and the Directors of Spanish Football put forth are:

1-**Fatalism**: Nothing can be done. Spanish Society is Racist, Football its Racist, The World is Racist. I'm not buying it if this was the case, then how are Brits able to do something about it?

**2-Empathy towards the evil doer and not the victims:** I've seen this with Spaniards but also with Argentinians. Like,'Oh those poor working class people, they don't know any better."" If you start giving them fines you'll be doing them a great harm since they don't have much money' I heard some Spaniards say, ""Vinicius and other minority players are rich they need to get over it.""

**3-It would be too expensive:** Some people say that if they start implementing these reforms it would be too expensive and they would lose fans.

What do you guys think? How was the Premier League able to overcome these objections?",0.54,4,0,4

Within that time he‚Äôs broken into the first team under Lampard with other cobham graduates. Many Chelsea fans would probably agree that this was a very fun and likeable team, a weird season where we had a transfer ban and lost Hazard. Pure Vibes, whatever happens, happens. No one knew what was gonna happen that season but we pipped top 4 with the likes of Tammy, Mount, Tomori and Reece. Under club Legend Lampard, this seemed like a fairytale with Mount as the main character.

Fast forward, he has won back to back Chelsea player of the year awards after joining a prestigious list of Chelsea players that managed to get 10+ Goals and 10+ assists in a season. He played week in week out during these years and also has the CL Final assist under his belt as well and every manager he played under loved him. Before this season he was a regular England squad member. Was seen as one of the best young players around.

What happened?

Terrible terrible season last year yet Mount had done more than enough for Chelsea for many fans to be understandably upset when it seemed like he was about to join United. This was Chelsea‚Äôs poster boy, at the club since he was a child‚Ä¶He get‚Äôs sold for ¬£65m. Before the season, many said United now had one of the best midfields in the league, Mount, Bruno, Casemiro yet you probably won‚Äôt find many saying the same thing right now.

United have had a what seems to be, shaky start to the season yet only find themselves 1 spot out of Europe. Mount‚Äôs been injured for parts of it but even when he‚Äôs played has looked tired, just like last season. Not in the England squad and currently benched for United.

Football is heavily subjected to recency bias. Chelsea with strong results against Spurs and City‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt think many Chelsea fans would have Mount back in the team. For who? Midfield looks great, Sterling is playing well and Chelsea fans seem to particularly like Palmer. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any regret in selling him?

CB: Thiago Silva - In my opinion hes one of the best cbs in the world right now, he is a very humble person as well and the fact hes one of the best at 39 is insane.

205,football,Why is the German national team so weak?,"# In this post, let's discuss the root causes and factors of the weakness of the German national team, and enjoy the journey to Germany's return to power.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, it is my personal opinion that defense is the most important thing in modern football.

Therefore, although it has been pointed out that the German national team lacks forwards and strikers and has a low scoring ability, this is a problem, but I disagree.

As is clear from today's match against Turkey, the German national team loses games by conceding more goals than the team's scoring ability.

Argentina's strength in winning the Qatar World Cup.

And the reason for the strength of Argentina, which is ranked 1st in the World Cup 2026 qualifying.

This is due to their high defensive strength, as Argentina concedes very few goals.

The only time we conceded was two goals against Uruguay.

This is tied for best among CONMEBOL World Cup 2026 Qualifiers.

Currently, there is not a single decent defender among German football players.

Therefore, in order for the German national team to make a comeback, it is urgently necessary to develop defenders.

The German national team will continue to lose in official games until they improve their collapsing defense.",0.7,25,0,25
206,football,Apart from Messi who do you think is the greatest ever dribbler,"Obviously most people think of him first but there is definitely a few players who come very close, for example Neymar, Zidane, ronaldinho, Ronaldo (Nazario), etc.",0.75,105,0,105
207,football,The large number of weak teams in Europe calls for a preliminary qualifying round.,"There are teams in Europe that will almost never make it to any tournament‚Ä¶all they do is make the numbers and thus increase the number of games competitive countries have to play. 

In Asia and Africa, they already have different stages of qualification, although it‚Äôs a different setup to what I think Europe needs. 

My take is the countries with the lowest FIFA ratings should play a two-legged knockout fixture (or a one-off could be a better idea) and then proceed to the main qualifying round. 

What‚Äôs your take on that?",0.63,12,0,12

209,football,Germany's era in football is over for good,"Turkey lost to Japan 4-2, and Germany lost 3-2 to Turkey.

It's so strange that such a weak Germany is ranked 15th in FIFA.

Germany has become a middle-ranked country both in name and reality.

Japan dealt the final blow to Germany.

Germans should come to Japan to learn football.

Germans should study football in Japan's J League.

The Germans will never be able to beat Japan in football again.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

By the way, don't forget the fact that Japan won a comfortable 4-2 victory over Turkey with the second team, the B team, rather than the best members.

The German national team went into the match with an unusual strategy of using Havertz as the left back in a 4-2-2-2, but there is no doubt that they had the best squad, so there is no excuse.",0.41,0,0,0

Surely it is one of the levelers of the game. If you are a big enough club to have international class players, in the past you had to accept that those players would be missing for part of the season. You have a big enough squad, manage around it. Chance for the lower reaches of the table to make up some ground. Chance for some youngsters to get first team experience.

However, I will naturally go onto my right foot for dribbling and taking a first touch and most skills, in which I have far better control with.

2009-2010: This one had absolute bangers; Man Utd vs Milan and Man Utd vs Bayern were the absolute standouts. Inter's journey was pretty badass as well, especially against Barcelona. Seeing Jose eating Pep like that was pretty special.


2011-2012: Chelsea's journey was even more badass considering they were in such a messy season. Also, Bayern somehow knocking out one of the greatest Real sides to ever exist. And Chelsea dispatching Messi in his best year. Plus, the final was amazing.

2021-2022: I would include this one because it was hilarious; Ancelotti dropping his eyebrow and his side would automatically pull the most unlikely comeback to ever exist. Also, Villareal's deep run was pretty amazing, absolute giant slayers.

2003-2004: This one, I admit that I was to young to remember but damn!! Porto and Deportivo knocking out those absolute monster squads that Man Utd and Milan had.

282,football,my alternative scenario for the transfers during the first Gal√°cticos era at Real Madrid from 2002 to 2006,"the main issue on the transfers during the first Gal√°cticos era at Real Madrid between 2002 and February 2006 (when Florentino Perez resigned) was the lack of balance; too many attacking outlets and little-to-no defensive transfers. if I was Perez at that time, I would do it a bit differently, balancing between attacking and defensive, and also between popularity and necessity. here is how I would do it.

1. **Summer transfer window 2002**:

CB option 1: Fabio Cannavaro, Italy, age 28 at that time, from Parma (yes, long before his actual transfer in 2006)\^  
CB option 2: Alessandro Nesta, Italy, age 26 at that time, from Lazio\^  
CB option 3: instead of Woodgate (which came in 2004), I would suggest a bolder option, which is Rio Ferdinand. an English, age 23 at that time, from Leeds United\^  
CF, Ronaldo Nazario, Brazil, age 25 at that time, from Inter Milan (actual transfer)

\^not all options had to be bought, at most two in each position

2. **Summer transfer window 2003**:  
DM option 1: Patrick Vieira, France, age 27 at that time, from Arsenal\^  
DM option 2: Massimo Ambrosini, Italy, age 26 at that time, from AC Milan (would be quite sensible, because he faced tough competition against Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso and Cristian Brocchi in AC Milan)\^  
DM option 3: Emerson, Brazil, age 27 at that time, from AS Roma (long before his actual transfer in 2006, which I think was a bit too late)\^  
CB option 1: Gabriel Milito, Argentina, age 22 at that time, from Independiente (almost became reality, but he did not pass the medical test due to injury)\^  
RM, David Beckham, England, age 28 at that time, from Manchester United (actual transfer, but I partially disagree because of the redundancy)

\^not all options had to be bought, at most two in each position

3. **Summer transfer window 2004**:

\*CF, Michael Owen, England, age 24 at that time, from Liverpool (again, this is the actual transfer; without the weird ""having-to-play superstars"" policy, he would have got more playing chances, especially when Ronaldo Nazario got injured while also having weight issues, and stayed in Madrid for a bit longer)

\*no need for other transfers like Walter Samuel, Jonathan Woodgate and Thomas Gravesen, because, according to this scenario, we already brought defensive transfers for the past two years. up until this part, unlike in real life, the team would be a bit more balanced with at least one more true defensive-minded midfielder.

Let's compare the line-up of the Clasico on 20 November 2004 to the hypothetical version according to this scenario:

Actual:

GK: Iker Casillas  
DF: Francisco Pavon, Walter Samuel, Michel Salgado, Roberto Carlos  
MF: Guti, David Beckham, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane  
FW: Raul Gonzalez (SS), Ronaldo Nazario (CF)

Hypothetical:

GK: Iker Casillas  
DF: Alessandro Nesta, Francisco Pavon, Michel Salgado, Roberto Carlos  
MF: Patrick Vieira, Massimo Ambrosini, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane  
FW: Raul Gonzalez (SS), Ronaldo Nazario (CF)

as can be seen, on-paper it looks a bit more balanced between attack and defense. in real life, from 2003 to 2006, they did not get any silverware (mainly due to the imbalanced squad), but with my suggested alternative signings, I think they could be a bit more fortunate.

4. **Summer transfer window 2005**: I mostly agree with their 2005-06 signings, except for maybe two Uruguayans Diogo Ense√±at and Pablo Garcia. although I would have added one more player for the full-back positions:

LB, Ashley Cole, England, age 24 at that time, from Arsenal (one year after the invincible season, he could be a back-up and ""future"" replacement for Roberto Carlos, especially when the Madrid board had not considered Marcelo at that time)

for the right-back position (to back-up Michel Salgado), they already brought Sergio Ramos, but in case they did not, I would have suggested Philipp Lahm, a 21-year-old from Germany and Bayern Munchen.",0.5,0,0,0
283,football,Serious Question: Why is the Premier League much better at dealing with Discrimination/Racism than La Liga?,"Hey guys,

Talking with many people and doing my own research I have come to this conclusion. For instance, I've read about player who went to the Premier League and were not called by any ""Racially charged"" nickname by their fellow players. Something had to go  through on other leagues especially La Liga. 

To me this is ""Common Sense"" and I don't believe the ""term of endearment"" argument that some people put forth, usually closet racists. Since ethnic identification should be more of ""private matter"" and has nothing to do with  football or work collegues or friends on the pitch. For instance,if I had a friend from a different ethnic group I don't think it should be up to me to start giving him nicknames based on his ethnicity; To me that's crossing the line. 

I've also heard the Premier League fans at the stadium behave better than the La Liga. I seen videos of how  Spaniards behave towards players from  minority groups. They'll shout all kinds of racial slurs. It seems to be a extremely hostile environment. 

The three main objections that Spaniards and the Directors of Spanish Football put forth are:

1-**Fatalism**: Nothing can be done. Spanish Society is Racist, Football its Racist, The World is Racist. I'm not buying it if this was the case, then how are Brits able to do something about it?

**2-Empathy towards the evil doer and not the victims:** I've seen this with Spaniards but also with Argentinians. Like,'Oh those poor working class people, they don't know any better."" If you start giving them fines you'll be doing them a great harm since they don't have much money' I heard some Spaniards say, ""Vinicius and other minority players are rich they need to get over it.""

**3-It would be too expensive:** Some people say that if they start implementing these reforms it would be too expensive and they would lose fans.

What do you guys think? How was the Premier League able to overcome these objections?",0.56,6,0,6

Within that time he‚Äôs broken into the first team under Lampard with other cobham graduates. Many Chelsea fans would probably agree that this was a very fun and likeable team, a weird season where we had a transfer ban and lost Hazard. Pure Vibes, whatever happens, happens. No one knew what was gonna happen that season but we pipped top 4 with the likes of Tammy, Mount, Tomori and Reece. Under club Legend Lampard, this seemed like a fairytale with Mount as the main character.

Fast forward, he has won back to back Chelsea player of the year awards after joining a prestigious list of Chelsea players that managed to get 10+ Goals and 10+ assists in a season. He played week in week out during these years and also has the CL Final assist under his belt as well and every manager he played under loved him. Before this season he was a regular England squad member. Was seen as one of the best young players around.

What happened?

Terrible terrible season last year yet Mount had done more than enough for Chelsea for many fans to be understandably upset when it seemed like he was about to join United. This was Chelsea‚Äôs poster boy, at the club since he was a child‚Ä¶He get‚Äôs sold for ¬£65m. Before the season, many said United now had one of the best midfields in the league, Mount, Bruno, Casemiro yet you probably won‚Äôt find many saying the same thing right now.

United have had a what seems to be, shaky start to the season yet only find themselves 1 spot out of Europe. Mount‚Äôs been injured for parts of it but even when he‚Äôs played has looked tired, just like last season. Not in the England squad and currently benched for United.

Football is heavily subjected to recency bias. Chelsea with strong results against Spurs and City‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt think many Chelsea fans would have Mount back in the team. For who? Midfield looks great, Sterling is playing well and Chelsea fans seem to particularly like Palmer. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any regret in selling him?

295,football,Dream lineup as in your favorite players.,"Dream lineup

Ive seen lots of posts of ‚Äúgoat lineups‚Äù or ‚Äúbest lineup‚Äù or ‚Äúbest lineup of blank‚Äù. But i havent seen a post about an 11 of players you enjoy. So for this post just tell us your favorite players 11. (can be because of on or off the pitch) 

Mine is:

LW: Son - Not only is he one of the most enjoyable players in the prem rn, but he also is a great person off the pitch as well.

ST: Giroud - Im a Chelsea fan but also like AC Milan and so Ive seen lots of Giroud and enjoy watching him play.

RW: Messi - Hes the reason I started watching football and probably a big reason on why I started playing as well. Hes my goat and is an undisputed top 2 of all time.

CM: √ñzil - More of a 10 but i wanna fit him in the formation because he was so enjoyable to watch and seemed magical with the ball.

CDM: Kante - No reasons have to be put.

CM: Valverde - I enjoy watching him play as he is a very well rounded player and I think he is one of the best CMs in the world for how well rounded he is.

LB: Chillwell - Ive always been drawn to him and when hes not injured he truly is an amazing fullback able to cross in the box and dribble and such. He is also my current favorite player.

CB: Sergio Ramos - Come on, its Sergio Ramos.

CB: Thiago Silva - In my opinion hes one of the best cbs in the world right now, he is a very humble person as well and the fact hes one of the best at 39 is insane.

RB: Reece James - Great player when uninjured, possible one of the best. And he is a great lad off the pitch.

GK: Tough one but ill go with Neuer because of the way he revolutionized the goalkeeper position.",0.88,64,0,64

297,football,Can we talk about Mbappe and Haaland scoring no freekicks?,"I was watching some goal highlights of both players and it dawned on me that they have never scored a freekick! It is kindof depressing that the two supposed faces of football lack so much to their game. Mbappe is probably the player most would agree is the best in the world but the fact that he is doesn't bode well for the coming generation.

Why do you think both players have been so abysmal at freekicks? They don't need to be great but at least score at least one. My goodness",0.32,0,0,0
