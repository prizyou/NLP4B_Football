This is like the Red Wedding of futbol games. ;;reddit
German here. Love this team, but WTF Brasilia, are you even in the stadium?;;reddit
"I´m feeling so sad for the brazilian fans right now. 
But otherwise I´m german and giggling like a girl ";;reddit
7 - 1 - Most embarrassing semi, since I went to see Brokeback mountain with my dad at the pictures.;;reddit
7-0 score, I'm a german, but at this point I want brazil to shoot a few goals. You just don't beat someone to a pulp like that, not on live tv.;;reddit
I tried uploading the video of the match to Pornhub, but they wouldn't accept rape. ;;reddit
it's like basketball;;reddit

"""It will be a great game!"", they said.";;reddit
This reminds me of the Canucks vs Bruins game that started the Vancouver riots. I could barely believe my eyes when I came in at 3-0, and it only got worse, RIP Brazil.;;reddit
im waiting for the first one who called this match sold;;reddit
The only way Brazil is going to score is by own goals.;;reddit
The ghost of Colombia! ;;reddit
Somebody's going to be very sad today. Brazil seems to have lost its fighting spirit.;;reddit
As a German, I think I will have to change my pants;;reddit

Missed the game. Anyone can tell where can I download the full match? Thanks.;;reddit
"Funny story: I've had some accumulator bets and the last match on those tickets was Germany to beat Algeria. Just one goal would have been enough. But noooooo, the fuckers couldn't even take a free kick. And now this happens...

6*;;reddit
This is the worst defeat I've ever watched, just wow;;reddit
It's crazy that I could've missed 4 goals if I just had gone to kitchen for 5-6 minutes to make a cup of tea;;reddit

As an England supporter, wtf is sterling doing , he keeps diving for no reason ffs.;;reddit
Highlight of the match so far, my girlfriend asking “what we are booing at?” and the only acceptable answer was “being Italian”;;reddit
Well won by Italy. Congrats.;;reddit
I only get into football in major tournaments so I know my level of patriotism is probably insultingly low for some people but, as an Englishman, bloody hell this was fun to watch. The whole tournament has been tense and exiting. Congrats Italy 🇮🇹 congrats England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 and thanks for making these past few weeks fun again;;reddit
Holy shit the pope is there!;;reddit
Anyone else see Mario and the Pizza Jester in the crowd. Who leaves the house like that!?;;reddit
If you can't beat em, kill em;;reddit
Italy got the nicer fans ngl;;reddit
How long til the riots start?;;reddit
Those substitutes at 119' were the biggest mistakes, followed by putting Saka as the 5th taker.;;reddit
As an Italian, i must say that we are playing like shit;;reddit
It's definitely going to go to penalties. I predict riots in city centres tonight.;;reddit
Not confident. Donnarumma is a fucking mountain;;reddit
the power of the pope strikes again. gg italy.;;reddit
Best luck to that dude who missed on that pole;;reddit
"Not the most entertaining game, but the best team on the day won.  
Italian's were more creative, England had great spells, but resorted to long ball football for much of the 2nd half.   
Nobody disgraced themselves.  
Chiesa and Shaw the pick of the players on each side.";;reddit
ITALIA ITALIA ITALIA;;reddit
Karma for the German girl;;reddit
how does southgate put that weight on sakas shoulders such a terrible decision;;reddit
CONGRATS ITALY!!;;reddit
Fair play Italy, you deserved it.;;reddit
Fantastic game! Both teams played hard to the end. Well done Italy and good game England. I hope to see both in the finals again in the future.;;reddit
I love Italy and Italy has always been my second team, but tonight I'm supporting my first team England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🤍 🇮🇹;;reddit
Good god the tension;;reddit
England in control at the moment. Going to be dangerous now with Grealish out there. Hopefully Italy can steady things a bit and wrestle control back.;;reddit
Can we get an F for grealish?;;reddit

Damn that was a good save.";;reddit

Nasty;;reddit
Holy shit. History;;reddit
Incredibly close match and incredibly well played by both teams, was routing for England but GG Italy you played well.;;reddit
If you look at the stats, you can see Italy played a belter.;;reddit
Seriously, this was a great game! So much better than the Copa final. GG Italy, and GG England. Italy was slightly better, so the result was accurate, despite the dramatic fashion;;reddit
Well done Italy deserved on balance but England played well and could’ve gone either way. Fans were better today and regardless of the moron mentality of some England fans our team culture has been excellent throughout the tournament.;;reddit
It's going Rome!!!;;reddit
That cross was on point.. damn;;reddit
One of fastest playing I've seen in a while. That early score is going to keep this moving;;reddit
My beagle Jack loves to watch football, any football. But especially when there’s a Brit doing commentary. I swear he bets on the games.;;reddit
Fair play Italy, nicely done.;;reddit
How long is extra time?;;reddit
"England goal keeper. 100% commitment on that shot. 

He was hugging that as Italian ran up to kick. That was a solid save. Kick to head at that momentum would of been nasty.";;reddit
Okay why is Southgate substituting a sub? Like why?;;reddit
Wow! Rashford;;reddit
Home is in Rome.;;reddit
Yesssss;;reddit
ITALIA!!;;reddit
"England here. 

The Italy that won tonight was an Italian side I was not expecting. I was expecting tears and crying and diving  and red card drama and got … like none of that. Just a good team.

Well played, Italy. It’s not bad to lose to such a team";;reddit
Another long past due debt paid by football. Mancini's first senior international trophy with Italian national team!;;reddit

If their fans weren't such pigs I would feel sorry for England. I wonder how many of the Italians at the Stadium will make it home tonight.;;reddit
Even football wanted to stay in the EU.;;reddit
5-1 italy (yellow cards);;reddit

Would have been a disgrace had England won. 5/6 games at home with 90% home crowds in what was supposed to be an Euros held across the continent.;;reddit
LET'S GO ENGLAND!;;reddit
Well, England is honestly playing much better than Italy so far, the defence is great;;reddit
Bloody good shot from Italy right there;;reddit
Both teams diving because they're playing football lol.;;reddit
ITS GOING ROME BABY;;reddit
Thank god;;reddit
"If football was likened to a boxing bout, then Gareth southgate just sits on the ropes for 12 rounds, hoping he doesn't get ko'd.

I don't understand why he doesn't try to throw punches back with the attacking talent he has in the squad. Go and win the game.";;reddit
Did I just hear them booing the Italian anthem?;;reddit
Dang, Italy plays rough this game. Holy;;reddit
Donnarumma and Pickford are both beasts, but I am glad that Italy won in the end to be honest;;reddit
Maguire, pickford, and kane played well. Grealish came on late, and tried, but couldn't do much. Italy played an even better game though, and seeing their roughness, compared to England's flopping about like fish, was funny. Obviously, italy wasn't perfect on that: they took a few dives. But england was worse I think;;reddit
Aren’t we all happy because England lost?;;reddit
Holy shit;;reddit
Y'all saw Tom Cruise in the stands? I wonder who he's rooting for;;reddit
This ref is annoying !!;;reddit
Close call for England!;;reddit
Italy deserve that... Been dominating this half 👏;;reddit
Southgate's faith in Mount is mindboggling;;reddit
Alright how can y’all say this ref is favouring England lol;;reddit
It's still coming home come on engalnd!!!;;reddit
3rd yellow card to ITA now;;reddit

Does anyone have a video of the streaker? The most entertaining thing all game and they don't show it. I mean I get why they don't show it but still;;reddit

I enyojed tremendously to see England beaten. I am not an Italian fan, by the way.;;reddit
"Might as well body slam him if you’re only handing out yellows.

Dumbest shit I’ve ever seen.";;reddit
"That was an nasty foul, yellow card?

Really?";;reddit
Slow motion has ruined fans perception of calling yellows/reds etc. It looks malicious at 0.25x, what about at normal speed? It's careless but not malicious imo.;;reddit
"Lol.. I dont see any ""its coming home"" now.. What happened..?";;reddit
as English man it’s ashame we lost but we didn’t deserve to win we got dominated the majority of the match. The fans who shout racist chants also are absolute goons.;;reddit

England lost - THANK GOD - As a Welshman having to hear the BBC harp on about 1966 for 54 years is bad enough. I just didn't want to go to my grave hearing about this match .;;reddit
England are world class atm;;reddit
I’m supporting Italy but good lord is it hard to cheer for them when they constantly waste time by flopping;;reddit
Worst subs of all time?;;reddit
Absolutely gutted for Pickford. The man played exceptionally the whole tournament and in the final, only to be let down by his team in the end.;;reddit
How the hell is that not a red card?;;reddit
The pinnacle of Italian football is intentionally pulling an opposing player down to the dirt by their collar.;;reddit

THANK GOD dive god Sterling and Kane lost. That's all i hoped and i got it delivered, easily my favourite ending of all time.;;reddit
First time watching soccer in years. Love the sport, but man there's a lot of diving.;;reddit
Italy looking dangerous so far this second half. Hopefully can build some momentum and level things up.;;reddit

Fair penalty, however the Italian player doesn't need to act like they have to amputate his leg.;;reddit
Horrific subs by England for the penalties;;reddit
"Good game everyone!

Any reason why Italy didn't have another penalty kick there? I'm confused -_-";;reddit
"Well fair play Italy clearly not favourite at the start just goes to show you don’t need superstars to win a tournament.

"Sterling may not be a world-class player, but he's truly a prodigy when it comes to diving. No player in the world can dive like that man. 

And hey, it's the one factor that got england this far! Let's take our hats off to england for what they really are the champions at - complaining.";;reddit
"Let's be honest, it's a lot more accurate to say it's coming home when italy wins than if england, a second rate football nation for decades, had won. 

Great game italy, fuck england who only got here because of the officials.";;reddit
"Says a lot about this sub that there's way more people telling the English to go fuck themselves than there is congratulating the Italians. It's almost like it was never about football for most of you huh?

Congrats on the win team Italy.";;reddit

If any englishman wants to know why noone from outside england supports their team, i think they ought to listen too the deafening booing whenever italy does anything.;;reddit

Sterling cost the game for England. So many opportunities close but was trying to draw fouls in the box. Shameful;;reddit
Go Italy;;reddit
How long is halftime? Haven't watched soccer in years.;;reddit
How come nobody is talking about how unfair it is that the game is inEngland? 3rd game in a row in Wembley? England as a Corona hotspot?? Italian fans have to travel there 14 days before the match to watch it because of quarantine?! Can‘t tell me that this EM isn‘t bought hahah;;reddit

I’m also a Wolves fan, and I go crazy for every single Wolves match there is. But is it normal for me to not care about England for the last 15 years or so?

I’m happy we got to the final this time, but any old Wolves match has always filled me with far more excitement.";;reddit
Wow. How unexpected for England to Lose in their first Real test. Pathetic sportsmanship (dives All over), pathetic hostility and pathetic footballteam. Hope they wont win anything for another 60 years.;;reddit
We're all going England crazy!;;reddit
