7 - 1 - Most embarrassing semi, since I went to see Brokeback mountain with my dad at the pictures.;;reddit
7-0 score, I'm a german, but at this point I want brazil to shoot a few goals. You just don't beat someone to a pulp like that, not on live tv.;;reddit

Well won by Italy. Congrats.;;reddit
I only get into football in major tournaments so I know my level of patriotism is probably insultingly low for some people but, as an Englishman, bloody hell this was fun to watch.

Incredibly close match and incredibly well played by both teams, was routing for England but GG Italy you played well.;;reddit

Seriously, this was a great game! So much better than the Copa final. GG Italy, and GG England. Italy was slightly better, so the result was accurate, despite the dramatic fashion;;reddit
Well done Italy deserved on balance but England played well and could’ve gone either way. Fans were better today and regardless of the moron mentality of some England fans our team culture has been excellent throughout the tournament.;;reddit

Dang, Italy plays rough this game. Holy;;reddit
Donnarumma and Pickford are both beasts, but I am glad that Italy won in the end to be honest;;reddit
Maguire, pickford, and kane played well. Grealish came on late, and tried, but couldn't do much. Italy played an even better game though, and seeing their roughness, compared to England's flopping about like fish, was funny. Obviously, italy wasn't perfect on that: they took a few dives. But england was worse I think;;reddit

I have said it before but we really have lost our defensive identity. Everyone can score against us and most teams can score multiple times and they all know it. We surely have a quality problem, players like Lahm and Boateng have stabilized our defense for years but we also try to many different setups with coaching decisions which are weird at least.;;reddit

Still think that the lack of a proper 6 is the main reason for our defensive issues. Henrichs-Tah-Rüdiger ain't that bad but they can't do shit when the midfield is basically non existent whenever the opponent wins the ball and just runs or passes through/over the midfield with no pressure. One of Kimmich or Gündogan has to be sacrificed for a 6 who may not be as good on the ball as them but atleast offers some defensive stability.;;reddit
abdülkerim will probably make a transfer. first the united game and now this game. bro’s on fire;;reddit

Honestly , if Bagelsmann just plays a 6, things would be much much better.

Why do we need Kimmich-Gundo-Wirtz as creators? That's more than enough, one must be replaced. Some teams even play with just a 10 and 2 defensive midfielders.";;reddit

"Tough loss, albeit by way of a stupid pen.

Havertz at LB was actually really good, I can see him work well there with some more experience as he got caught out of position a few times which is expected for your first ever match there.

Encouraging performance still imo";;reddit
Germany losing is always a good time, even if its just a friendly.;;reddit
I love how everyone tries to find a position that Havertz is good and still fails lol;;reddit

if bale had scored that pen this would've been the best individual performance of the tournament by far;;reddit

"If Wales can get to second in the group they’ve actually got a really decent run for the next few games. Really difficult to say who’s gonna do best against Italy between Wales and Switzerland though, but if Italy win tonight I would expect them to rest players against Wales so that might end up favouring the Welsh.

Also wouldn’t be surprised if Turkey totally fall apart against the Swiss.";;reddit

Soyuncu the only player who can actually defend today for turkey;;reddit

Bale and Ramsey, after missing chances and pens, showed what it means to be Welsh, never give up, keep working til the end

I don't care what people say, bale is a roll royce of a player, even after that missed pen;;reddit
"Couldn't be prouder of this team. From top to bottom they were superb, fantastic performances all round. Joe Allen has become a meme but fucking hell he was solid today with some really nice reads in defence, love that lad.

"Wasn't necessarily why they lost the game but you can basically sum up Turkey's defensive efforts today by letting Bale spin away after pretending to hold it in the corner, giving up a great chance, conceding a corner and letting him do exactly the same thing again

Thought Morrell was great and Roberts deserved his goal, whilst other players were out on their feet he was a complete workhorse";;reddit
Icing on the cake that goal for Roberts, he was fucking sensational throughout.;;reddit
Those four cards in the end saved my bet lmao;;reddit
What a banger of a game. Enjoy Wales fans!;;reddit
My congratulations to Wales from Kurdistan;;reddit
Yes, Turkey was poor, but I want to talk about one of the unnoticed players of the day: Joe Morrell. I watch a decent amount of football, and had never heard of the guy, but he had a good game. He seemed to be everywhere, just like Ramsey.;;reddit
Wales vs Italy is gonna be a spicy one.;;reddit
Ramsey MOTM?;;reddit
hakan ready to go to maldini and accept anything he's offered. mans a perennial choke artist. should be no where near milan. spurs is a perfect place for him;;reddit
I honestly thought everything in football had been tried out by now. But no... Gareth Bale apparently waits till the Euros before inventing a new type of corner kick. One that's so devastating he can get away with it twice on the run.;;reddit

Fuckin hell boys that was a bit special wasn’t it?! Cymru am byth!;;reddit
My call of Wales winning the Euros inches ever so closer to fruition;;reddit
I liked Savage on commentary;;reddit
Turkey's defence was genuinely terrible. Don't know what the commentator was talking about praising Soyuncu towards the end, maybe it was one of the only players they know? While Wales were running at them, they just backed off, committed cynical fouls and allowed Wales to walk right through them. Last couple of minutes was a joke from them too;;reddit
It’s the history of the ottoman;;reddit
Find it extremely funny everyone saying Italy are the main contenders, after France, because of their match versus this Turkey;;reddit

Here comes the time wasting bullshit again;;reddit
"Good playing Croatia. Much respect.
Congratulations France!";;reddit
Why the fuck are you playing Pirates of the Caribbean? At least play We Are The Champions or something;;reddit
"`Pogba.exe has stopped responding`

Hope someone will GIF it.";;reddit
The tears of the Croatian president makes me sad :(;;reddit
Croatia's president is so touchy. I like that.;;reddit
LOL! Umbrella for Putin,  not for the presidents of Croatia and France ;;reddit
Lol Putin couldn't stop rain so they brough an umbrella guy.;;reddit
I just hope croatia fire keaps burning for euro 2020;;reddit
"1 shot, 2 goals

France = FIFA 18";;reddit
KARIUS RETURNS FROM THE GRAVE ;;reddit
I will have nightmares of that first half but France did better in the second, they executed their game plan to perfection, we just couldn't break them down. Congratulations are in order, I still can't believe I saw Croatia dominating a world-class opponent in a fucking World Cup final.;;reddit
Alexi Lalas just said the Griezmann dive was a foul and that “there doesn’t have to be contact for it to be a foul”. God I’m ashamed to be American whenever he opens his mouth. ;;reddit
Croatia’s dominating. Except the score.;;reddit
France won the world cup but Croatia won the hearts of the world. Croatia, keep your heads high, that was a phenomenal effort. Modric, you're  a gem! ❤;;reddit
Fortnite celebration should be instant disqualification from World Cup;;reddit
Hmmm that dive though ;;reddit
that already leaves a bad after taste and the match is so young;;reddit
It’s far from over, Croatia has been threatening the entire time, France looks like the worse team so far and got bailed out by the dive;;reddit
France already crying about calls after being gifted a goal ;;reddit
JUSTICE!;;reddit
"Croatia: 

You have activated my trap card

; )";;reddit
#WHAT A FUCKING GOAL;;reddit
"OG Check

Banger Check";;reddit
Lmao goes back for another look;;reddit
I’m all for keeping the game moving but for instances like this the clock has to be stopped. ;;reddit
Ref has extremely large balls;;reddit
Cringe;;reddit
Fucking fortnite celebration;;reddit
"My mom just asked, ""So they have to take the penalty from the spot in the box where the handball was?"" 

She's seen 250+ soccer games in her life.";;reddit
Croatia clearly better side in the 1st half. Quite a bit unlucky tho;;reddit
Really entertaining first half, though I feel like 3 minutes of stoppage wasn't nearly enough when you factor in the replay ;;reddit
France is playing pretty disappointing tbh;;reddit
Did Lalas just say there doesn't need to be contact to be a foul?;;reddit
This sums up this World Cup perfectly. An own goal, a set piece and a VAR penalty. Classic ;;reddit
What kind of shit show is this ;;reddit
Love how they didn't even try to show the dumb ass intruder so they didn't get the attention they wanted.;;reddit
There are hundreds of yellow shirts lining the field.  How does that happen?!;;reddit
France was so good defensively against Belgium, now they're giving away chances left and right. Croatia unlucky not to have equalized yet. ;;reddit
Pogba with a terrific pass then finish;;reddit
What is Subasic doing?;;reddit
All the extra minutes catching up to Croatia now.  Referring decisions haven’t helped them, but those are some tired men.;;reddit
This is the first time I've seen Croatia shook this tournament. ;;reddit
hahah now this is a shitshow;;reddit
Wtf is this game?;;reddit
Wtf this game is insane ;;reddit
Lloris is a fucking dumbass;;reddit
France choking this would be hilarious;;reddit
WELL DONE CROATIA!!! KEEP PUSHING AYEEE;;reddit
Wtf is this game;;reddit
"Croatia cannot afford to play for the next 20 minutes like it's over. Because it's not.  

Cannot allow the tempo to die down.   ";;reddit
Oi ref, fuck out the way;;reddit
Goals scored in this final = Goals scored in four previous finals combined = 6;;reddit
Remarkable run from Croatia regardless, well played HRVATSKA.;;reddit
Looks like France are gonna be out in the groups in 2022.;;reddit
France won, but Croatia played outstanding, great job to the winners and runner up! ;;reddit
Brutal. Congratulations France;;reddit
Really sad, but this was a really beautiful game. And a final. You don't see that so often...;;reddit
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS MUSIC??;;reddit
Modric with the Golden Ball well deserved. Courtois also well deserved;;reddit
"> Russian authorities have dealt with these things with a smile


Is there a more sinister phrase than “Russian authorities have dealt with”?";;reddit
Var should be used to stop this shit. Fuck.;;reddit

Ronaldinho playing drums is the most random thing here;;reddit
Louis Vuitton case for the World Cup hahahahaha;;reddit
Bullshit;;reddit
#5* WEAK FOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;;reddit
Man Subacic sucking it up out there.;;reddit
[deleted];;reddit
Dive leads to a goal. What bullshit.;;reddit
[removed];;reddit
r/soccer is gonna be very salty tonight;;reddit
Smh at all these racists saying that the French team is just Africans. Majority of these “African” players were born in France and without French youth development they wouldn’t be the players they are today. They are French no matter their ethnicity. ;;reddit
That  take the L celebration wont sit well ITT lol;;reddit
Stoppage time is football’s biggest downfall. Why not just pause the fucking clock when shits going on. No one wonder players waste so much time rolling and diving and arguing, they’re basically incentivized to do so. They know the amount of stoppage time added on will never be as much as the time that was actually wasted. ;;reddit
Croatia definitely the better team. France ahead with two lucky chances. As long as Croatia hold up at the back, I see them tying the game at least in the second half. ;;reddit
Feels weird to see a tottenham player lift a trophy. ;;reddit
What is the point of VAR if they can't use it to tell the referee if the player is diving.;;reddit
[deleted];;reddit
this is all the tears of r/soccer;;reddit
Where the fuck did Will Smith come from?;;reddit
My heart is checkered red and white today.;;reddit
dive LOOOL;;reddit
If they score it's more evidence for expanding VAR;;reddit
Griezmann you fucking twat;;reddit
OP terrible with updates.  How is this the official thread?;;reddit
I'm sure this VAR call won't create massive amounts of salt.;;reddit
Damn Subasic.. my heart stopped for a second;;reddit
Only 3???;;reddit
Why are France playing like they have a lot less talent? So timid and cheap;;reddit
I know stats are barely anything, but how is France winning with [these stats!!](https://i.imgur.com/a6WIK2T.jpg);;reddit
Should be 1-1 right now, and Croatia is playing better.;;reddit
LMAO 4?;;reddit
Imagine doing that infront of 2 billion people;;reddit
G U L A G ;;reddit
Throw them in the gulag.;;reddit
"Congratulations; you've won an all expense paid trip to Siberia!";;reddit
I don't mind if France win off goals like that. I'm still hoping for Croatia ;;reddit
Ok, now France can say they earned this. 2 legitimate, uncontroversial goals vs Croatias 1.;;reddit
"Fun fact:

2 more goals and this ties the 1998 and 2014 final for most goals in a single World Cup (171). 3 more and it becomes the highest scoring World Cup of all time. ";;reddit
~~2018 is the year of the keeper~~;;reddit
I can‘t get over Lloris‘ fuck-up, holy shit;;reddit
Best World Cup final in a loooong time, just by the amount of goals and funny shit that’s gone on;;reddit
This final already has as many goals as the previous 4 combined. ;;reddit
Props to Croatia for never giving up;;reddit
Should have been a corner.;;reddit
First world cup final in 16 years to not go to extra time.;;reddit
