This is like the Red Wedding of futbol games. ;;reddit

"I´m feeling so sad for the brazilian fans right now. 
But otherwise I´m german and giggling like a girl ";;reddit
7 - 1 - Most embarrassing semi, since I went to see Brokeback mountain with my dad at the pictures.;;reddit
7-0 score, I'm a german, but at this point I want brazil to shoot a few goals. You just don't beat someone to a pulp like that, not on live tv.;;reddit
I tried uploading the video of the match to Pornhub, but they wouldn't accept rape. ;;reddit
it's like basketball;;reddit
Mit dem Herz in der Hand und der Leidenschaft im Bein werden wir WELTMEISTER SEIN!!!;;reddit

"""It will be a great game!"", they said.";;reddit
This reminds me of the Canucks vs Bruins game that started the Vancouver riots. I could barely believe my eyes when I came in at 3-0, and it only got worse, RIP Brazil.;;reddit
im waiting for the first one who called this match sold;;reddit
The only way Brazil is going to score is by own goals.;;reddit
The ghost of Colombia! ;;reddit
Somebody's going to be very sad today. Brazil seems to have lost its fighting spirit.;;reddit
As a German, I think I will have to change my pants;;reddit

Missed the game. Anyone can tell where can I download the full match? Thanks.;;reddit
"Funny story: I've had some accumulator bets and the last match on those tickets was Germany to beat Algeria. Just one goal would have been enough. But noooooo, the fuckers couldn't even take a free kick. And now this happens...

This is the worst defeat I've ever watched, just wow;;reddit
It's crazy that I could've missed 4 goals if I just had gone to kitchen for 5-6 minutes to make a cup of tea;;reddit
