And on the top of that they behave like at home, where they have no respect for the police, and no following the rules.<br>So, they could do us a favor, and never set foot again in our country, since all they bring is trouble. No wonder their country in an eternal economic crisis for the last 50 years. It&#39;s a bunch of hooligans running it.\n",
