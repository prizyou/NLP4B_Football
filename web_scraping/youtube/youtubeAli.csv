0,"The people that organized this would also think it&#39;s a good idea allow palestinian fans be next to israel fans, or russian alongside ukranians. <br><br>What in the world were they thinking."
1,"These are two national teams that should have more security measures. In the pasts, they have instances of violence resulting in injuries or even death. Most of these who paid the price we’re Argentinian fans and players. FIFA should know better when having fixtures involving rival national teams. If they play another match together, you might as well get the SWAT or even the national guard to do crowd control."
2,"Every Brazil x Argentina match ends like this, no matter what is the hosting country, always been like this for the last 50 years, they just can&#39;t have a single peaceful match"
3,that&#39;s why mexicans hate Argentinans so much😂
4,Argentina &quot;took care&quot; of you
5,thats what you get for racism
6,I&#39;m really disappointed with Brazil&#39;s police.

9,"Argentinos são baderneiros e racistas, por isso apanharam. Eles precisam aprender a respeitar as pessoas, principalmente quando estão num país que não é o deles."
10,🤣LOL
11,"Showing bad behavior to Argentina is very rude for Brazil. I didn&#39;t think that Brazil, who love to support the world of football, would do this? Messi seems to respect and love his fans very much. Argentinians who are united. I saw Messi&#39;s fans being beaten. I feel very sorry for the Argentines. 😢❤"
12,People might have to conceal their emotions when sitting with rival fans.
13,Common thing in Brazil
14,Those police are thirsty for blood. Kind of psychotic actually.
15,Imagine three seconds later you hear gunshots💀
16,Brazil did this on purpose. Argentinian fans were surrounded by Brazilian. So the blame fall Brazil.
17,"Argentinians are ALWAYS the problem...if you don&#39;t believe me, look at the Final game of Libertadores in 2018, between Boca and River Plate, both Argentinian teams. The violence got so out of hand, that they had to transfer the final game all the way to Spain, so Argentinian hooligans could not afford to travel there.<br>And every time the Argentinians comes to Brazil, their fans are always into street provocations, stupid chants,  and of course, starting fights for no reason whatsoever.  And on the top of that they behave like at home, where they have no respect for the police, and no following the rules.<br>So, they could do us a favor, and never set foot again in our country, since all they bring is trouble. No wonder their country in an eternal economic crisis for the last 50 years. It&#39;s a bunch of hooligans running it."
18,"Don&#39;t generalize Brazil, just the police, the whole of Brazil is not to blame for this attitude, don&#39;t generalize Brazil."
19,the level of uncivilized poor countries

21,Sometimes its undercovers  who start riots just for innocent people to end up killed.

31,"La.policia brasilera es brutal. Les han pegado a todos los hinchas y equipos sudamericanos que juegan de vsitante. Leo a los moralistas que dicen no saben comportarse, no entienden nada.."
32,Brazil was looking for a conflict to either suspend the game and playing on so other time when their national team stop sucking or forcing FIFA to punish Argentina  with some point deductions.  The organizers know they should not put those fan together but they did it anyway.
