Go on Lukaku Reppin for The SlapHeads 🤣
👍
"Belgium like England, win the easy games then bottle it when it matters."
so Lukaku and Mbappe are the cookers of the euro lmaooooooooki
Considering Belgium history I&#39;m surprised so many black players choose to represent them
I can see Lukaku playing for arsenal Arteta should consider him
"Lukaku has now scored the 3rd-most goals by a European - he&#39;s just one behind the late, great Ferenc Puskas"
Lukaku the flat track bully.<br>Invisible against real quality.
What makes Azerbaijan...mm................European? Next well have Saudi and Quatar in The &#39;European Cup&#39;..?? ....its fuccin crazy lol
What a player lukaku is chelsea are mad for getting rid of him doku just gets better and better with each game both for club and country 👏
Lukaku turns into prime R9 for Belgium
Shame on you
Lukaku is only just getting started…
"Doku good talent, lukaku practiced those headers 😅after that crap in the final, let&#39;s see the performance with better team lol."
Azerbaijan you sell outs.Go join your friends israel in the L club.LOSERS!!!
Lukaku
It’s amazing what a player can achieve when they don’t play for man united 🤣🤣
"Belgium a threat for Euros, they&#39;ll slaughter England"
"1, that keeper is absolutely shite and 2, that was clearly offside"
lakaka chokes when the games a serious all this other small games with no pressure hes good at shining
I be pissed if i was lukaku get taken off at half time i would want records of most goals by single player at euro qualifier
"Lukaku making history. Like him or not, he sets records. So happy for him. 4 goals within the first 45 mins is no small achievement. 👏"
JUST A SHAME HE ISN&#39;T BELGIAN 😮
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOzVhY_pBAs&amp;t=3m26s"">3:26</a> i swear lukaku is saying im him to the cameras"
"Belgium is now a young squad. There are some good players. For the moment Tedesco has been play8ng around a lot and trying a lot of different tactics and players. <br><br>So grom there, we can have a good surprise or a bad surprise with that team."
"Well, very similar to previous performance in the pass, in group stage bullying some weaker teams, when facing some stronger teams in the knockout stage, it&#39;ll be another story.<br>Anyway, congratulations to Lukaku and Belgium, hope they can keep up with the performance"
"when shit lukaku scores this many goals, u just know Azerbaijan must be extremely shit"
Lukaku is very good but he never seems to perform when it actually matters.
Belgium 🇧🇪 team looks a strong one.
"Romelu Lukaku always delivers for his national team, what a lad!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOzVhY_pBAs&amp;t=1m18s"">1:18</a> says “he cleaned Lukaku up” 💀💀💀💀 racist mf wth"
International Lukaku imo ranks in the top 5 strikers of this generation. He is unplayable. 83 goals in 113 apps is MAD!
Isn&#39;t Belgium in Europe? They look like a team from Africa
"Why Azerbaijan even playing in euro qualification when there next to Iran ffs, and also free karabakh from Azerbaijan, karabakh is Armenia. Why nobody protest or talk about this war"
United could really do with a player like Lukaku right now……
Good to see lukaku back in form
Doku and lukaku had a great game 🔥🔥‼️
"When the fuck did Azerbaijan become a European country 😅. Absolute joke. Azerbaijan, Israel, Kazakhstan and there&#39;s probably a few more I&#39;m missing that need to go. Not Europe"
I swear he barely touched Lukaku
This is a lukaku fixture if there ever was 1
Why are people talking about Doku. Who cares about City. Lukaku&#39;s night.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOzVhY_pBAs&amp;t=4m02s"">4:02</a> Lukaku 4 - Azrbjan 0, 😁😄what a humiliation by the commentator"
This game was yesterday boys
Lakaka looks HUGE
&quot;I am him&quot; says Big Rom after the fourth goal!
whats even more impressive is ronaldo was second top scorer with 11 goals at tender age of 38
"Lukaku is a pub stomper, kills smaller teams but in the big games man never shows"
"Lukaku, more goals than touches"
Does Belgium’s manager wear makeup ? 😂
Couldn&#39;t score for Chelsea still wouldn&#39;t have him back
Lukaku turns into Real Madrid Ronaldo when they’res nothing to play for
Lukaku masterclass
Lukaku is a world class player❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
LEOOOOOOOOO
"Imagine when KdB is fit. Doku ,Trossard and Lukaku. Deadly"
LAKAKA my goat
"😂🤣😅 Love how the thumbnail for the vid shows three &quot;Belgians&quot; - all ♠.  Getting worse than the not-very-England team.<br>And before any of you simps tell me Lokaku was born in Antwerp, where your mother happened to be when she gave birth to you is a very small part of &quot;where your&#39;re from&quot;!"
"That&#39;s Belgium?? Yikes, the replacement is going faster than I thought. (tell me I&#39;m wrong in a few decades)"
Lukaku is absolutely world class 👏
Why does Azerbaijan compete to get in the euros when it’s in Asia
I know it’s only Azerbaijan but I wish Lukaku had this form in the WC or Champions league final
"Come back to EVERTON lad,we wer the only fans who appreciated you🙏"
LAKAKA 😂🤣😆
Doku is phenomenal. Brings back that old wingers feel to the game. Not so many of them left tbh
"Belgium has solid team ,iran was unlucky"
I think Belgium will be somewhat of an unknown quantity going into the Euros. A lot of their old guard is gone and it&#39;s going to be interesting to see how some of the youngsters perform.
"He’s moaning about the second yellow, he’s very lucky it wasn’t a straight red"
Doku Lukaku Trossard Belgium got a solid team
Lakaku with 4 what a player 👏
"Commentator : Romelu Lukaku 4, Azerbaijan nil 😂😂😂"
Why is no one talking about doku masterclass??
I would pick lukeku over halaland and lewandowski any day
23/24 has been a good season so far for lukaku
So glad to see my boy Trossard get a goal. Could care less about the rest of the game.
bro said romelu lukaku 4-0 Azerbaijan 💀💀💀
lakaka has done surprisingly  well this year&#39;s qualifiers
All well and good that he&#39;s scoring so often again but he always chokes when it&#39;s important
LAKAkA. Is something special..
Greatest striker OAT
Hello there
Lakaka

I will never Understand why a 19 years old boy had to take the Last Penalty for England.
Donarumma 🥶
Lol I watched this 100 times just to dunk on these idiot England men.
In my veins!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwvV06FvXbg&amp;t=0m25s"">0:25</a> crowd reaction 😭"
bravo african players
"The Donnarumma&#39;s reaction is normal: after a save, a goalkeeper has to wait for the judgement of the Var, because in few seconds they check if at least one foot is on the line at the moment of the kick."
Stiamo ancora godendo.
This euro cup was better than world cup 2022
Better than 2022 world cup.
2023🔥🤙😊
I remember watching this idk why they made him took it at the age of 19 now he’s ofc world class
Is this free to use in edits
The most surprising thing about this was just how damn good Maguire&#39;s penalty was.
England never wins a european cup.
I Love pengland
Considering he scored 3 goals in the competition <br><br>why would you not pick Sterling to take one BEFORE Sancho and Rashford here? 😂<br><br>Surely the player who had the better tournament should be up to take one first 💯
cockroach penalty takers
Wow
английские негры ни одного удара не забили
What a terrible penalty shoot out it is.
Southgate🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Poor Bukayo.
better lose by a a slave than win by it
I don&#39;t think Donnarumma even cares
we should of won this got cheated out of this game so bad
I dedicate our win to my late brother Franco x
All the africans missed
Saka Is finished
That&#39;s too bad......Saka means football in Japanese...
Pickford youre not that guy pal
DANG DONNARUMA SAVED THAT WITHOUT GIVING US BLANKETS 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
England lost their first final and at Wembley too. Lol 😂😂😅
Italy and England is like 1 sided rivalry for England Italy is an extremley tough opponent a football giant with 6 trophies that they just can never seem to defeat except in non important games like Friendlies and for Italy they see England as a small team with only 1 trophy from 1966 and whenever they face in a major tournament it&#39;s an automatic victory for Italy despite England being capable of bringing Italy to a penalty shootout like if they face in a group stage it&#39;s an automatic 3 points for Italy if they face in a Quarter-final it&#39;s an automatic qualification to the next round for Italy and if they face in a final then Italy automatically wins the trophy
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤
&#39;HJow Bad you wanna be in penltu shopt? H<br>e E ngland
this euros(2024) will be our year.I am probably wrong
"u guys are all dumb, donnaruma said after the game that he didnt know it was finished"
Still didn&#39;t qualify for the next world cup. Embarrassing
england is t=not aawys the best but atleast they tried🥲🥲🥲🥲😭😭😭
I love watching this every few days.<br>It&#39;s gone to Rome! ❤💪😍
Let the country down
I laughed so fucking hard when the only people that missed the shots were the diversity hires.
It isn’t coming home😔

Just another day at the office for the Italian keeper 🧤
Donnaruma da goat
Donnaruma so cold
Sunday 11th July 2021
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwvV06FvXbg&amp;t=0m31s"">0:31</a>"
"I was pessimistic that day. i was on the beach watching the mach. to England&#39;s goal I simply said, we&#39;re the seconds of europe, that&#39;s okay. but then. something clicked, a sort of pride, &#39;let&#39;s show the queen we can conquer britain at their home.<br>the rest is history."
"The fact that Maguire, the worst cb in the premier league was more composed and scored an amazing penalty while the 3 biggest front prospects missed is astounding to me but in a funny way"
Why would you let an overrated English teenager take the last and decisive penalty on a world stage like this lol??!! They deserve to lose on this one alone.
There was no doubt in this match that the two best penalty takers in the stadium were going to score. Very good penalties from Kane and Maguire.
if Saka scored...
Put this into my veins.
Harry Maguire 😂😂
"Donnarumma sembra che sta al parchetto sotto casa di quant è tranquillo, era cosí concentrato che pensava solo a parare rigori manco esultava"
THE GOAT OF ENGLAND HARRY MAGUIRE 🐐🐐
Poor Pickford he has done all what he can but still not enough
A gift to legend Gianluca Vialli
Donnarumma 🗿🗿
It’s coming rome
This Never GEts Old though JOrginho should have been replaced who would cost them making World Cup missing PK too.  Putting guys in the 120th minute who don&#39;t belong on the pitch really worked out.  Italy had that happen where guy they subbed in at like 120th missed the PK leading to a loss too :).  Reminds me of 2012 when England gets crossbar after Buffon dove the wrong way. That is still better than getting the post on the ground when guy is laying on ground :).  Man when I played we wouldn&#39;t even be on team if took PKs like most these guys.  All this BS instead of just picking a corner with velocity or side. Even right at the goalie scores more than trying to be cute.  When up 2 1 gotta just get it on net at very least ;).  Glad Italy Finally Won :).
Rashford and Marquinhos both hit the left post
When you miss a penalty that even Harry maguire scores
english is double harry scorred
notice the only people that scored that night were named harry
Best euro final
"And now, Italy 1-2 England, hahahaha."
"Donnarumma 🥶<br><br>March 25, 2023"
This hurt too much. Like someone had died walking into school the day after.
Donnaruma just walked and said  it’s too EZ for me…🥶 🥶 🥶
"felt bad for the kid , heads up saka"
Italy : Wins championship through penalties
"If Marcus Rashford had made that penalty, England would have won. Would have kept the pressure on Italy"
Rushford is the only way
Still can&#39;t believe Maguire (the goat of defending) took a pen and scored it
anulo mufa a cr7 y portugal
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwvV06FvXbg&amp;t=0m35s"">0:35</a> on god"
finally rashford recovered from that day and is playing a lot
no matter it said tiktok on the ad boards for maguire&#39;s shot
"Football Wasn&#39;t Coming Home,But Football Was Coming To Rome, FORZAAA ITALIAAA 🏆⚽️❤🇮🇹"
"I searched up Harry Maguire pen, I ended up here."
England would have needed David Seaman!
Saka’s miss was heartbreaking
Respect for harry maguire
The fact that this team has not played in 2 WCs blows my mind. <br>I remember how chiesa turned prime messi and destroyed England. Shame he couldn&#39;t score the winner penalty.
The fauled the whole game tbh
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwvV06FvXbg&amp;t=0m32s"">0:32</a> GOAT strikes again"
Euro final and World Cup finals both finish on penalties 😒 👎
“ Legend says “ shut up kid
R.I.P. Gianluca Vialli
Why so rudefull to England. Ok England fan may be disrespectful but player really deserve euros ❤
Why everyone hate england national team😢 I mean i find nothing to hate this team .they go all the way to final but lose. England really deserve a cup ❤
Maguire in the national team is just something else
So what did I see<br>Magurie scored<br>Rashford missed<br><br>What?
Rest in peace Gianluca Vialli
RIP legend gianluca vialli.
Gianluca Vialli 🙏🇮🇹

Italia is number one in the world of racist 😠
"le racisme c&#39;est une realitè moche, alors unissons tous ensemble et allons tous casser la gueule de toutes les raciste lol"
Golazo de súper mario
SAY NO TO RACISM <br>IT HAS NO PLACE IN FOOTBALL
"Yeah , but can he do it in a cold rainy night in Stoke?"
Bah...
Pazzesco Balo!!
"Forza Balotelli!!!! Serie A, kick all the racist fans out, penalize the teams, do something instead of denying and moving on. It&#39;s time. This needs to stop."
Balotelli de siempre.
World class goal...also love his plyng style...he s a great man..
He scored this after being racially abused and threatening to walk off during the game.
"Serie A fans full of idiots, racism screaming everywhere"
World class goal. Hope that can shut the racist fan up
Beutiful
"Honestly I don’t understand why no top team would take a chance and sign him, clearly he’s still has quality"
"This might not be read by a lot of people but Balotelli will have one of his best moments in his late years in his career. It might not be in terms of stats but a better outlook of things in the sport. He looks more humble and contained, hopefully that comes with more wisdom. A well seasoned Veteran he is becoming."
Why he took early retirement from national team ?
COME AND GO
He still got it!!!!
Non avrà lo scatto di un centometrista ma la mette dove vuole
This man is so talented
Super Mariyo
Era pra ser do Flamengo
balotelli should play for ac milan again
Mario.... Ti amo
Forza nerazzurri
Too quick even for the camera 👌
"super mario,, the best"
wonderful goal ! love mario

I don&#39;t why he always score best goal.
And yet he&#39;s still angry lol
Super Mario Balotelli!

Super Mario!!!
Super top Mario Balotelli!
Baloteli tem pelos chutes certeiro i fortes bom atacante 👏👏👏
They forgot to mark him🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Brilliant! The goalkeeper was on that side as well.
Balotelli to juventus. Its the perfect time we need a cf to exchange games with higuain. Balotelli is now super experienced and will be motivated to play with Ronaldo and co up front
"He taught those disgusting racists a lesson, don&#39;t mess with super Mario."
O outro tinha tudo pra chutar à gol...
"Mamma mia, gran gol...<br>Se siete interessati ad analisi tattiche sul calcio passate dal mio canale!"
"He responded well to racism here. Racist Italy, Racist Serie A"
Bravo Mario
Amazing gol... The problem is that defense of Brescia is a disaster.!!
Gran bel gol... inutile ma molto bello
Le Boss!!
"Balotelli tendria que estar jugando en un grande de europa, tiene una categoria impresionante"
Why Always Me? Hats off 💪🏻
Ma non poteva tornare al Milan o all’inter?
🇮🇹🖕🏽
2019 dan masih ada rasis?ayolah ini memalukan!
"Super Mario ancora una volta colpisce ancora <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23perunmondomigliore"">#perunmondomigliore</a>"
"che gol, e l&#39;ha fatto con una semplicità pazzesca!"
"Serie A doesn&#39;t really care about racism, thats the truth.<br>While everyone feel they had to do something significant, yet this channel only capable of liking every comment about Mario and the goal. Disgusting. I&#39;ll never watch the league again anymore."
Gran gol il Balo👌
No to racism!!<br>Please stop.
No to Racism ! Italian Fans Always Do This
"What,a goal man"
Lalotelli
Sempre stato un grande talento.❤️
Italianos Rasistas
Sarà anche finito come hanno detto sti qua..ma un goal così li zittisce subito!! Grande Mario
Come on!!!!
"Super Mario still the best Italian striker with has back to goal,"
That guy casually strolling back from offside when his team is behind made me really angry for some reason.
This guy’s striking technique is still top class
And they say America&#39;s racist lol
Troppo forte super Mario!!!
Fans got what they deserved
Shut all the racists up. ✅👑
Grande Mario💪🏿❤️
"i hate this player....but really happy to see him score after he went off the field following racist abuse by the home fans..<br>We all are equal...<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23No"">#No</a> to racism.<br><br>Italians need to grow up..!"

La velocità che prende il pallone quando la calcia lui diventa IRREALE. Si dirà sempre tutto e il contrario di tutto su di lui. Ma la potenza che sprigiona quel destro è imbarazzante!
20 sec unskippable ad for a video less than one minute. Seria A racist nonces
"Super Mario non ascoltare quello che ti insultano, sono solo dei cafoni"
Allora il gol é bellissimo non c&#39;è niente da dire ma perché?                 Solo perché é al centro di un polverone BISOGNA fare santo Balo? C&#39;è ne sono stati di gol simili o addirittura uguali ma per fare i buonisti hanno deciso di farci un video a parte 🤦‍♂️
Its really disgusting to see what happend to him in this game.<br>And what does Serie A do about it? Nothing. Shame!
Great gol super mario!!!
Balotelli joss
Voglio vedere se sti razzisti avrebbero il coraggio di dirgli e fischiare in faccia ste cose..
Super Mario Super Serie a 🇮🇹💪
I hope one day he plays for Italy again. Hope he has a blinding rest of the season and gets in the squad.
Liga italia sangat rasis kpd Balotelli😆😆😆Federasi tidak bertindak tegas pada tim Suporter yg rasis

That alex krul strike gave me kean vibes😂
In this day and age modric dont really be gettin mentiond y hes one of the best midfielders in the world even now he needs to get some more recognition in my opnion
Wait 😮 why did Real Madrids third goal look like Fifa Animations 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXv4jah29U&amp;t=5m49s"">5:49</a>... the Don... cool as F"
"Next penalty Bellingham should take it, it&#39;s ridiculous that they&#39;ve missed 3 in a row"
Real need a striker ASAP.<br><br>I&#39;ll leave it as that.
"Joselu, 2 goals or not,  awful"
RM equaliser for 1-1 was def a foul.
Haha Berlins first goal a handball no? watch it back slowly. I must be some kind of deluded as nobody seems to mention it. Yeah looking back it seemed to be Vázquez&#39; hand so maybe that&#39;s why.
42 millions for 6 wins and for qualifying..the best team from the world..Real Madrid
"It’s amazing how Real Madrid unlike other big teams can have good players who aren’t elite or world class just good and yet still feel like a favourite for the champions league. In very few other elite clubs would players like Vazquez, Nacho, ceballos remain for as long as they have and a player like Joselu actually perform to the levels he seems to when he’s needed"
"I think UB deserved a draw at the very least, shame!"
1st Real goal clearly a foul.
Saying Real Madrid thought they&#39;d cracked the code might not be too welcome in Berlin 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXv4jah29U&amp;t=2m40s"">2:40</a> dude was Alaba trying to do an overhead kick pass or what? 😑"
Real Madrid definitely will get knocked out by someone big in the knockouts ❤
What a game the stadium’s great too
"that header goal, if a player has his hands on shoulders keeping a player down is that not a foul in the game? cause that guy had his arm pressed across the back of the defenders neck keeping him from jumping never mind from looking upwards"
That stadium is horrendous 😂 it look straight out off the Soviet Union 😂 so sad
Union are back
What a game
Joselu passion for each goal he scores for Madrid is unmatched 🔥
Its crazy how many ex Stoke players are in top teams now lol
How does Lucas Vasquez play for real I’ll never know
Who&#39;s no 14 for Real Madrid ? its the second time I&#39;m watching their UCL Highlights and its like they&#39;ve found their own Chelsea version of Timo Werner. Im not sure they can win a UCL with him upfront. seems to take him 5 chances to bury a goal. Is he in for Vini who i heard was injured during international duty ?
"im sure we were all on berlin&#39;s side for this, really wish they clutched out the win"
"I had both Bellingham&#39;s to score last night, didn&#39;t expect it to be Jude to let me down."
How on Earth was this match tied at 2-2 with 88 minutes to go?   Real Madrid had so many chances.   However Real Madrid kept going and got the win.
Modric miss the penalty
They need CR7 for penalties.  3 missed by real Madrid already
CEBALLOS? Gave me the maddest ptsd from the covid era.
"Bellingham is a proper  baller , sheer quality."
Who’s stadium?
I wanted bellingham to score but at least he got an assist at the end
Can’t except everyone to be happy🤷‍♂️
Can’t except everyone to be happy🤷‍♂️
Can’t except everyone to be happy🤷‍♂️
"I&#39;m happy for Joselu scoring but that first goal for RM tonight was definitely an offensive foul, how not?"
Ace game
Joselu for Ballond&#39;or
Que bien por Joselu se lo merecía 🎉
Arsenal could beat Madrid i reckon
"I love the fact that TNT actually show the full highlights, not 1 minute clips like sky"
"Clueless people calling foul on Joselu&#39;s 1st goal. Berlin player tried to drag him before ball was played &amp; when Joselu was in the air with left hand on the shoulder, his other arm was dragged down by Berlin player trying to stop him like a judo slam."
"We taking season by season lightly. It&#39;s now a norm to tie or even loose.<br><br>I miss the 2014 era where we couldn&#39;t afford to loose<br><br><br>I think barca going down making us relax a bit.<br><br>If this goes on and Barcelona sinks, we might have to face atletico and Valencia and possibly that girona with loaned players taking the league."
Union celebrating like that when they need another goal. Prats
That Real equaliser is a foul like
Ridiculous from the union defender to grab joselu like that. Deservedly got climbed over like a prat
Belingham winning the CL guys.
Joselu?.....couldn&#39;t hit a barn door in the premier league....just saying...
Whoever makes the thumbnails needs sacking
"Commentators are so funny. Bellingham inches away. Apparently miles away, another strike was so close, 2 yards away. Lol"
I remember saying when Barcelona beat Real Madrid in a pre season friendly that Barca might win the league by 20 points because Benzema left 💀💀💀 how wrong I was ffs 🤦
What an atmosphere. Much respect for union Berlin fans
Fantastic Madrid it&#39;s another level
first goal for real was foul jesus christ that push in cl
Credit to Union Berlin - One of the best football stories
won me 160 quid. close lol
Eisern Union
Why did we sell Ceballos
Dani Ceballos Arsenal ❤
Thumbnail looks like a Mortal Kombat finishing move 😂😂😂
"Keppa is fkn garbage, Lunin is better."
First RM goal was a blatant foul. Can’t get more obvious than that. It’s not like they need the help.
Did that first RM goal not even get looked at?
"Im so confused why our manager put in almost a full squad in this game, i was hoping to see our youngster play, however its a nice win"
First Madrid goal is a pretty obvious foul no? Hands all over the defender who cant even jump because of it
No one speak about Ancellotti? The best coach ever. Absolutely legend at his age..
Jude is phenomenal! Zidane was nowhere near this standard at his age! There srent many who have been!

Union Berlin stadium seems like a dark castle<br>It gives out an intimidating sensation that I can’t explain. Similar to galatasary
"Ngl, that&#39;s low quality game 😂"
That Bellingham ball for the saved Rodrygo header was outrageous. So nonchalant and casual.
Thanks for saving my bet
❤
If Reals first goal had missed or been saved it would have been a stone wall penalty for sure
"Might be some of the worst finishing I’ve seen from Real Madrid, up there with Rafa tonight"
"Joselu reminds me of nunez, tries his best until he finally scores😂"
I suppose I&#39;m unlucky? But at least I had Real Madrid to win (1-3) <br>Great Football 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Madrid - the team of miracles
well played!
Some really weak defending from Real tonight.
fault at Joselu&#39;s first goal
Corrupt officials in favour of Madrid..AGAIN their goal climbing all over the defender obvious foul but referee not interested… disgusting!!!!!
That pitch is just sad
Union Berlin the most unlucky team in ucl this year
Bellingham is everywhere
Great season for Joselu he deserves it!
Dani Ceballos still plays football lol. One of the worst players in lockdown for arsenal 😂
Commentators should stop this “how has he not scored” nonsense…
what’s funny?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXv4jah29U&amp;t=3m20s"">3:20</a> “ how has he not scored” coz the keepers just made a worldie of a save 🤦‍♂️😂"
Madrid beat team in Europe?
"Does make one wonder just how weak that la Liga is, when Real Madrid can win it more often than not and yet struggle against a Team such as Union Berlin.<br>Great game though :0)"
Both of England’s superstars getting winning assists - built different
Bellingham 🔥
This is Real Madrid 🤩
"What a game, no one except that!"
First
0
Onana stuck to his line... 🤦‍♂️... Might aswell not have been there..
"Kane is special, his vision and passing is up there with the very best we&#39;ve ever seen"
Remember when people thought Kane would choose Utd 😂
United are good
"Can i just say, the fans were an absolute disgrace in the stadium. Why pay and come to the match just to be a spectator in a must win game. The Bayern fans were having a blast and could be heard louder than 70+ thousand fans. A joke, stay at home if u cannot generate an atmosphere"
Antony has to be a contender for the worst signing United have ever made
"That goalkeeping was completely shocking on the goal. Made the finish so easy for him, you’d expect the keeper to come out and put pressure one on one. Stays so far back was actually shocked seeing it live"
Embarrassing from Man U and the money they have at their disposal to finish bottom of that group 🤣🤣
"Entitled, elitist &amp; corporate prawn sandwiches, deserve everything get!"
Wtf keeper doing that far over
Onana springing off his line like a leopard... NOT
Hahahaha....Manchester is blue and will forever be blue💙💙💙💙🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
kim kim kim
Sane celebration early killed me 😂😂😂😂
lol united
😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Coman might be bayerns best player since robben and Ribery, I swear the bloke always puts in a 7/10 in the champions league, I definitely don’t watch every Bayern league match but he always looks class."
Does the keeper know hes allowed to come off his line 🤣
I do not believe it Man United loose again
Man u only shot on target was the 23rd minute and it came from a defender…
King Kane 👑
Arsenal fans please let’s not laugh at these loses 😂🤐. Let’s save this for the end of the season. COYGS! 💫❤️🤲🏾
Ten Hag is out bruh
"The unfortunate reality is that with some basic competent goalkeeping, United would have already qualified from this group. They are still a pretty mediocre team though, and Bayern looked like they didn&#39;t even have to try too hard to beat them."
"ETH should be sacked for allowing scouse rats to talk their s**t. If we dont beat the rats by at least 3 goals, hes got to get sacked."
Yesss am an old fan of Bayern and still support Bayern yess we beat man uited yesss
Old Trafford is falling down ten haag is a <b>*****</b> clown 🤡
Kamikazi&#39;d would be more fitting than crashed.
Commentary is absolute bobbins though as always
As a Celtic fan I can only imagine we&#39;ll be exactly like Man Utd tonight. Changed days from both teams doing well in Europe. Man Utd were always competing for every trophy when I was younger now look at them. Strange stuff.
Kane assist 🔥🔥🔥
Maguire comes off and they concede 😅
Who TF are Man Utd….😂
"How bad are Man Utd, honestly smh"
"Haha, small club."
"United are a football  team as any other they do not have a right to be in any competition unless they are good enough obviously that is not the case now so stop whinging  and get on with it exaggerated wages are killing clubs and football it’s about time wages were paid on appearance ,bonuses, along with a set wage across all leagues of the world ."
Halifax team better than UTD 💰💰💰💰💰
Why does Onana always stay on his line man.
Musiala is a baller! England missed a trick there...
The Glaser are toxic.<br>How many cups or championship have ManU won under their ownership?<br>About 2?<br>And how much money they&#39;ve borrowed?<br>Billions?
It was like watching a testimonial match. Bayern never even got out of first gear it was that easy for them
The loudest the home fans got was to boo United. Shocking atmosphere again
theyre still in the conference wdym
Farmers harvesting
Loved how Sane celebrated before the goal was scored
Why’s Onana stood on his line for the goal?!?! Get out and make a challenge at least man!!! Joke of a club 😂😂😂😂
The quicker man utd fans and all the pundits realise that they are just a mediocre mid table club the better. Their glory days are long behind them
TNT making fun of united. Life has peeked
Mctominay another sh.. performance
I continue to be enchanted by United&#39;s exquisite failure.
How does ten hah still didnt get the sack
"Funny thing is people are shouting tuchel out in munich for this bad performance, only beating united 1-0 is unacceptable for them, that is their standard ☠️united on the other hand.."
anyone else see onana fall over for the goal?
united struggling without Howard Webb...lol
Bye bye United 👋🏽😂🤣🤣
"I&#39;ve thought for a very long time that no manager has got a chance while they allow AF to lord it over and put even more pressue on them by always hanging around.<br>No doubt about him being a decent manager but was a bully of the highest order, especially against weak and pathetic referees of his day and how they allowed it to happen to them I will never know.<br>Keep going Mr F."
watching man u fans boo their team over a loss to bayern ...man u fans are part of their problem
"Sack him now, stop beating around the bush."
UEFA have written to Manchester United football club” UEFA have awarded Manchester United a certificate! Dear Manchester thankyou for taking part in the competition &amp; providing the crowd with entertainment &amp; laughter
Onanah letting coman score
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9Pv_bfunAQ&amp;t=1m22s"">1:22</a> great defending from Sane"
man united played good
"Man united fans are fizzing.<br>Boos echoing around OT<br>Going silent for 90 minutes, crashing out of the champions league in embarrassing fashion<br>Beautiful"
Is there really any point of them being there?
Are man utd a Scottish team ?
kim is a beast of a defender
Minjae is so good!!!!!
Crazy how Bayern won the game but the whole commentary focused on man United when they lost
"I’m not saying Obana would have saved it , but he did everything to make it as easy as possible to score"
How often does Darren Fletcher say &quot;And there&#39;s the chance..&quot;
How embarrassing
We can only hope that Ten Hag and his team keep up this amazing work they&#39;re doing at Utd 😂😂😂
"Most pitiful performance of the night in CL, Utd out with a whimper"
The title 😭
United are so finished 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"It&#39;s a pity the utd fan&#39;s didn&#39;t have the same energy for the GLAZER&#39;S OUT MOVEMENT than they do for the ETH OUT MOVEMENT, PATHETIC."
United are a mid table team living off the past
Brilliant assist by Kane
We can safely say Kane made the right decision
why the crying emoji hahahah united are so bad 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
United being a prem team and being 4th
"Why the 😭 emoji? United are washed, no one saw them doing any better"
"Man Utd, a team of couldn’t really care less, just take the money players. I can’t believe how far this once great team has fallen. 😢"
City top their group and Glazers United bottom of their group. Sounds about right.
That was killer assist by Kane.
Man u slowly dying
"Now United can concentrate on the &quot;We stopped Liverpool scoring at Anfield&quot; cup. The mighty, all conquering, swashbuckling entertainers, Manchester United have finally become the new Everton."
wow onana 😮 never before can I say one player has cost manu in this group stage so many continuous errors in games in a position that didn’t need changing 😢
Hahahaha united fans really thought they did something when they finished 4th last year 😂😂😂
"As an Arsenal fan, I&#39;m still bitterly disappointed in MU.They were once a team most if not all teams use to fear."
What is the keeper doing!!! LOL
"Apparently, Man U are having numbers printed on the front of their shirts for their next game to make it look like they’re attacking all the time."
"what a pass by Kane, amazing"
Only top 4 united will make
Harry Kane pass wow! Too good!
Bruno is an embarrassment
"Crashing out of Europe, next is crashing out of the premiership 😂"
Onana vot is my name Onana

Dem man dem got blitzed! 😄<br><br>Congrats to Inter and its fans.<br><br>What happened to Immobile lately?
Never in a million years would I have imagined myself cheering for Cuadrado. 😆😆
I never expected to see Inter in Orange lol
"Napoli had their moments, but overall Inter is far superior this season."
The inter passing was just beautiful
Hakan Calhanoglu 🚀!! What was that man? The way the ball getting far away from the goalkeeper more and more as it goes was phenomenal. It was pleasure to my eyes. 👏
Forza Inter
"Propozycja dla idioty, który jest trenerem Napoli:trzymaj dłużej na ławce Zielińskiego,to za chwilę będziesz szukał nowej pracy.Pozdrowienia z Polski i &quot;See you later,debilater!&quot;"
"Last season, Napoli showed a defense like an impenetrable wall, conceding the fewest goals. Minjae Kim left and the team now has an average defense."
Lautaro&#39;s foul on Lobotka not called by the referee resulted in Inter&#39;s goal two minutes from the end of the half up until then Napoli was the better team and that episode changed the whole game in Inter favour that goal could give Inter the championship in the long run

"This commentator is so biased towards Inter, as a neutral fan it makes it really grating to watch."
Napoli sold Kim and bought Natan!😂 The guy is one of the worst defenders in serie A. They bought average players after winning the title !
Why aren&#39;t the Napoli players passing the ball to osimhen?
En que idioma habla?
"Napoli didn&#39;t deserve to lose, a draw would have been a fair result."
Penalty for napolin but referee fan inter

Well deserved win for Inter Milan ❤❤❤.  Calhanoglu 🎉🎉🎉
Amala ⚫🔵
Barella is crazy🔥🔥🔥
Simone Inzaghi is genious

One season wonder Napoli
Why aren&#39;t they passing the ball to Osimen.
This Inter reminds me of mid-late 2000s Inter when they were dominating Serie A.
❤❤❤❤❤
Hopefully Barella becomes a beast for the rest of the season now.
Forza Inter❤

This guys my favourite commentator by the way lol 🎉👍
Turkish atmosphere is just so beautiful I&#39;ve said this so many times 🙌🏽
it looks unbelievable to execute a panenka?
Way too many spurs fans in the Bayern highlight reels 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
how was he clincal?
I can see BM winning UCL this season
First goal hit the water bottles at the side of the goal. Beautiful.
Harry Kane if he keeps this up he is gonna be a ballon dor candidate specially if England the euros
the pitch feel so orange
Icardi is on fire these days 🔥🔥🔥
Akturkoglu is just a bullshit
"typical, Kane buggers off with no trophies and spurs could win the league!"
Spurs fan. Adore Harry Kane ❤
Was Kane the only one who scored? No? You’d think so by every Bayern game thumbnail
They have to utilise kane more at champions league level. Sane and coman may be able to run around galatasary and those other mooks at bundesliga level. But up against quality defenders who know how to deal with pace theyl do nothing. Hes there to score and provide so do it bayern wont win at this level hogging the ball and trying to be clever all the time.
Musiala 👏👏
"Can a Bayern fan please tell me, what is Coman and Sane&#39;s beef with kane all about? Seem pretty chill to pass it amongst themselves, but when its Kane, all of a sudden hes invisible to them. Can&#39;t help but think Kane would so much rather be at spurs rn than this Bayern team, as good as they are, no disrespect."
Kane would be getting 4 goals a game if his team bloody passed to him. Imagine being top scorer feeding off scraps
&quot;have that&quot; someones fired up :D
Happy for Kane !! Looks like he’s enjoying himself
The commentary is so Partridge
Icardi panenka 😍
We played horrible in that first half. Galatasaray should be annoyed not to walk away with suttin and Sane had a absolute stinker
Galatassary fans are always saying they are the best club in the world when they aren&#39;t good thing there team got humbled
Galatasaray played suicidal and defending was on the shoulders of four players so Bayer easily exploited the numerical advantage in attack.
"first 55 minutes it looked very promising for Galatasaray, but after subs it just started to crash. If Kerem Akturkoglu had a better finishing he would have been playing for any PL team. <br><br>It was very entertaining game to watch<br><br><br><br>Gs li degilim"
Have that says the neutral commentator after the third goal lol
Kane and Bellingham I see can’t stop scoring goals 😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
"The title says Clinical Kane, but then the commentator says that he&#39;s been misfiring all night 🤣"
If Sane some minor aspects to his game like finding the right pass and keeping in his negative attitude then he would be a great player
"If kane continues in this current form, Ballon D&#39;Or"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Juo9j79-0Dc&amp;t=2m33s"">2:33</a> truly inspiring quote"
bro who is this commemtator hes so boring it sends me to sleep xD. he should be a golf commentator
Might as well stop running if Sane has the ball. He won’t pass.
If any of u actually watched the match galatasaray did very well amazing pressure but ultimately got tired. First half we dominated all the way up to 70th min then 75th min we conceded everyone was tired bayern defending then towards the end they walked through us..
sane is some player
Bayern might have the world&#39;s best attack rn but they need to fix that goalkeeper
First half Bayern couldn&#39;t touch the ball. Galatasaray played amazing until the 75th minute. Then they got tired and Bayern got the lead. Quality of the players but most importantly their conditions gave them a free win. In my opinion Gala deserved to win - at least draw - but this is champions league. Congrats to Bayern.
Those pricks ain’t team players and the manager needs to put a rocket up their arses.<br><br>We know who they are they need to start passing to their striker and this team would score a lot more goals.<br><br>This team won’t win this trophy as ego is more important than team.
"If G.S defance didn&#39;t make defensive  error, it was going to be different  story."
Thought Galatasary by them highlights deserved a point should have scored more but didnt take them!
"Something about Kane reminds me of Bobby Charlton. Even if he&#39;s not quite on the same technical level (who is), Kane shares the deep sense of humility, the workmanlike approach, and the fearsome clinical finish."
The commentary 😅
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Juo9j79-0Dc&amp;t=3m45s"">3:45</a> very Alan Partridge"
Sane one selfish player -
Kane is on another level
"Kane keeps it simple and makes it look easy, the other lads look like the skilled players at school that wont ever pass"
What was this recorded on an iPhone???
"Bayern players need to realize that Kane would have scored from that angle for the musiala goal but instead, he passed the ball because he isn&#39;t selfish and also knows  what to be done at the right time"
Would love to see galatasray go far in the tournament they have a good team
GS should have buried this game by half time.. good to watch
&quot;Have that&quot; 😂
bayern defence is still a bit open at times
Lets hope Bayern sell that sané and the other greedy players and bring in players who are gonna less selfish and more a team player.
Nice of them to get Alan Partridge on commentary duty.
Gala destoryed bayern until 72nd minute <br><br>Shouldve made changes around 65 min as some defenders were lacking a bit along midfield <br><br>Was a great fun game to whatch
Gala dominated the gane but are way to delicate off the ball
Bayern won with the luck factor. Galatasaray played better from start to finish
"Bayern wasn’t exist till 75, there was Galata show but no finishing so this is how football works."
What a improvement Kane is over mane
worse commentating ever XD
"Akturkoglu misses so much. An easy win becomes a loss, I hope he does go to Tottenham or Arsenal"
Galatasaray should of been 4-1 up
The world will now understand why &#39;Mane&#39; left..... it&#39;s a shame 😕
Galata had so many chances..pff
"If a player doesn’t want to pass to Harry, that’s fine. Just hand in 😊your transfer request and leave. Simples."
Haha
“Have that!” - The Commentator<br><br>😂😂
Honestly Galatasaray played really well. Just no luck
Bayern did not play in well but they always showed the different class.
Kane is the best striker in the WORLD. SIMPLE
This Akturkoglu guy can’t shoot.. he gets into incredible positions but he misses far too much .. he should have scored at least twice … they need to send him to a finishing school
Kane played for Tottenham.<br>Tottenham is a Jewish club.<br>Kane now plays for Bayern.<br>Bayern is a German club.<br>Jews do not like Germany.<br>Jews gave Bayern Kane...with their best wishes...😂
Freedom to Cyprus! Cyprus is Greek
Kane &amp; Bayern looking dangerous
Kane scored one basic simple sitter and all these people making a big deal about him but i think they are bots this cant be real lol
Harry Kane playing with a smile on his face...love it
Turks were good in the first twenty minutes. Bayern showed there class in the end though.
Lovely bit of Partridge on the commentary ‘have that’ after the 3rd goal. 👏
"Sane selfish all the time , that&#39;s why I don&#39;t like him , hope is not going to come in Liverpool Amin..<br>Fair play from B.M"
To many greedy players at Munich sane for one.
Ulreich is amazing! I&#39;m proud he&#39;s stepped up
"Give Tuchel halaand, he will make him rubish"
"I always say Turchel never know how to use no.9<br><br>All good no9 in his teams always look bad, no service."
Davies is actually horrendous
Kane #1
Kane certainly doing very well with Bayern. Pleased for him.
Kane doing the most for Bayern
"gala dominated the game until the second bayern goal, they absolutely deserved to win this game but it was unlucky"
With a title like Clinical Kane I was expecting more than 1 goal from Kane and not being in the 6 yard box for it
No one mentions Ulrich? What a keeper 😮
Mauro icardi breezer with a brilliant breezy pen
Bayer shouldn’t win this game they didn’t create chances it was lucky win
I was a fan of Bayern till they signed himm😂
Harry Kane is a excellent player. Surprisingly he hasn&#39;t won a trophy/medal. With him being at Bayern Munich he has got to get a trophy/medal this season
I think Kane is so good he would score even at Chelsea.
"Galatasaray should have gone 3-1 upfront 1st half. They missed about 7 decent chances. Bayern was boxed in their half full 45 minutes with only a counter attack. <br>Bayern started showing their class only after 60-65 minute, as Gala got tired. <br>I think Gala will lose the return leg in Germany too, next. But will qualify , as they are the second best team in the group."
What a pen from icardi ❤🐐🐐
"Kane is such an effective playmaker for a striker it&#39;s incredible. Nothing he does is particularly flashy, but he&#39;s super efficient. The way he comes deep for the ball and plays it through or heads it onto his wingers is something he does better than anyone else. Bayern really need to find a way to give him service without him having to move out of position though if they want to win anything."
I hate harry kane

"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_ihj34uCq8&amp;t=1m10s"">1:10</a> What are the commentators talking about? Incredible save? Onana couldn&#39;t have gotten out of the way if he tried 😅"
🇹🇷
Mason mount and  HQjlund are the only players that are saving us
I can’t believe icardi missed a penalty but scored a normal goal
Icardi very underrated striker
Ugly mejbri

wtf was lindelof doing for that 3rd goal lol
🇹🇷
Ne koyduk ama 🎉
Some finish for the winner by Icardi
Galatasaray played with Manchester United like cat<br>Play with mouse😂
I&#39;m surprised a small club with average players like Man United are in the Champions League.
"Over £40m for this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_ihj34uCq8&amp;t=3m58s"">3:58</a><br>Money well spent United fans?"
What even is this keeper😂 and wtf was rashford doing with that attempt on a sweaty goal 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_ihj34uCq8&amp;t=0m54s"">0:54</a>  Looooooooooooooooool  Oh-nonnaaananananananaaaaaaa!!!!!!!"
That keeper is a liability
What happened to my team
Unless he gets better at the moment i think onana could be the worst gk signing in the last decade he has been abismal its like watching a cb trying to play in goal and even his passing and composure on the ball is getting worse
thats s how GALATASARAY wiped out the manchester united 😂😂
Glory hunters
Imagine being a glory hunter with a club who have won one trophy in 7 years? Glory hunters support their clubs to win trophies. Plastics are ruining football. Support your local club. That’s what football is really all about.
Such a shame for Rasmus to play so well on a losing side. He&#39;s gonna be a Man U legend. ❤
How did United lose that game lol.
onana is a joke. Marseille used to have a laughable keeper like him. Just making tons of mistakes and they kept him for years. Unbelievable.
bring back David de Gea Onana is over rated
Icardi is crazy good.
Sunderland AFC 👑.
"real strikers do not lay the ball off when they get into positions like that, they bury it. RASHFORD IS A TOTAL BOTTLER"
And that&#39;s why André onana is the best goalkeeper in the solar system
"Hojlund, United&#39;s next Ronaldo."
"brooo, it&#39;s a mess in the defense.. they don&#39;t have a Roy Keane to scream at them.. they are probably giving Onana anxiety hahaha United would be great if it wasn&#39;t for the constant poor choices in defense... even the first goal.. Dalot tries to backheel the ball in that position.. it&#39;s like he doesn&#39;t care enough... if Roy Keane saw that he would&#39;ve been checked instantly... the defense acts veeeeery superficial..."
Gg
That’s the second time Casemiro has had to sacrifice himself for the shiteness of others.
Davinson Sanchez with a stormer of a game at the back and an assist for the winner 👍
"I&#39;d love to see onana&#39;s betting slips back home in Africa, something is really fishy about the way he&#39;s kept goal since he came"
This keeper is like something outside a chicken shop in Brixton. Bruno Fernandez is an absolute disgrace a waste of an underpants. Marcus rashford the biggest fraud ever to play for the club. Ten fags has some serious calls.
Hojlund looks like a cracking player
Gala ❤🧡
Onana is a terrible keeper
Højlund looks a great player for the future. If only the others had his desire and commitment.
"It’s time for Ten Hag to go, he’s clearly a fraud, we should sound out Phil Parkinson at Wrexham. He knows how to win."
Most entitled fanbase of all time. Where&#39;s that chest now?
Galatasaray the best team as always 🦁🏆
Manchester United are yesterdays football club.
De Gea is on the beach somewhere whilst these bums continue to earn a living.
Is Onana allergic to staying on his line smh
Man utd is the provider day in n day out .
Man Utd going from strength to strength building the worst defence in the Premier league. Maguire and &#39;Oh no i&#39;ve let another one in&#39; must have some right giggles in training about how piss poor they are.
And De Gea wasn&#39;t good enough. Apparently. Onana is shockingly awful.
manures 😮😮😮😮
The amount of money we&#39;ve wasted on bang average player after bang average player is just scandalous. It&#39;s got be some kind of covert money laundering scheme. <br><br>Hojlund looks like a decent signing for the future I guess. The only one of Ten Hag&#39;s purchases that gives me any confidence.
Keeper let more goals in start of this season than dea gea let in all year
nasıl susturduk ama tüm old traford u
Why do all man u/f fans have Cockney accents?14&gt;1 Amen.
‘Stunned united’ it was expected as every game for Utd
onana is pure caca 😂
Onana lol
"Rashford is terrible nowhere near the level of Ollie Watkins yet gets the call up by Southgate every year. Not consistent, decision making is poor."
"What is up with stewards in every Galatasary celebration, I see more of them than the players"
Been saying it for years and no racsim intended at all.... never buy black goalkeepers.
"Listen united are back, eras come to an end for klopp and pep, it&#39;s all about eth<br><br>Him and Onana are behind the wheel  and will steer us clear of relegation 😂"
Can we please get Neil Warnock in before it&#39;s too late
Galatasaray taking the piss on and off the pitch 😅😅
Three hag out
Aaa
for 30 years we bean wating for this..best gs
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How many times is onana going to get chipped like that
Waiting for Onana to come out and say he let the team down again ahahas
I think Galatasaray fans best Ultras in World. 73.000 was there and all heard is Gala Fans omg
"I was at the game,watched,then watched highlights maybe 100 times,its unbelievable,we have icardi and zaha,they dont😂yürüyedur galatasarayim❤❤"
🇹🇷
Mount as much of a flop as maguire was. That utd defence is ridiculous lol the midfield is shocking too. Lindelof is a donkey he didnt even mark back on that second goal he was caught sleeping
What a joke of a club😂
😎
"Amrabat at LB is not working atall. . Onana still making mistakes. Such a shame when Hojlund is on fire and rashford has decided to start lookinf for team mates. Mount shoeing glimpses,if they coukd sort the back 5 out they would be ok"
galatasaray get out the way!
Ohnono
Aint surprised how Manchester United bottled another game and this time from poor defending and goalkeeping 😔😑
Galatasaray 🤝Onana 💀
Galatasaray definitely should be thanking Andre Onana 😂😂😂🤝
Swear theys something wrang with Manchester united this year
We’re officially the biggest fools in Manchester😢
"Big up Wilf, bet he loved that!"
Who is that clown in goal for Utd?
Apparently we are all stunned every time
"Hojlund is a Haaland clone. He might never be as good but they’re both physical specimens, faster AND stronger than any defenders, they’re both very strong mentally, direct and they’re natural goalscorers.<br><br>He’s still a diamond in the rough, he’s not that easy on the eye with the ball at his feet but if he realises his potential he will be some player."
Welcome to Besiktas.
Onana isn’t fit to wear the shirt. Would have rather had dean henderson!
Kerem misses lots of chances but the 2nd GS goal was beautiful-I can’t wait to see how Man U handle the pressure from the Turkish fans in The Cauldron of Hell if they can’t take the pressure to win at home light work
What a keeper!!&#39; How much 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"who does Hojlund think he is, Bellingham???"
"The best thing comes out of this game is we’ve managed to get a World Class Striker,all we need now is a World Class team to go around him  😂"
who tf is united ‘s new goalkeeper he is absoulute dybolical
it’s safe to say United ain’t gonna qualify
"Good job Galatasaray, with one penalty missed 😯"

Not a chelsea fan but Rudiger&#39;s goal was so good it counts as 5 goals. So in the end Chelsea win 5-4
Legends come here to see Rudiger&#39;s celebration
Rudiger is. The best defender

YES when it&#39;s the same with berenfod bot
80% des commentaires : le but de Rudiger
HAHAHAHAHAHA
England FIFA World Cup
😂
"Losing to teams like West Ham, Brentford and Arsenal this season has created a lose in hope for winning the 2021-2023 EPL Trophy. Otherwise, we could have surely lifted the 2022 Trophy"
"To see a great of the game almost lose his life on the pitch, then come back, play so well and score in the Premiership within the year is truly astounding. Bravo Eriksen ❤"
Hahahaha
I end he highlight after rudigers goal
Rudiger 😭😭😭
This is a fixed match
That Goal From Rudiger Was So scary that was crazy
Rudiger wkwkwkwkwk
I&#39;m no Brentford fan but I think it was great that Brentford beat Chelsea 4 - 1 at Stamford Bridge. Absolute solid gold hahaha
rudigers goal is surely goal of the month or even the year
I am watching this league before Russian give this country nuclear... I hope not... War did it because stupid and racism politicians...
"As a Chelsea fan, I just have to applaud Eriksen&#39;s goal. He has been through a lot and has been remarkable ever since he made his comeback into football. What a guy, what a player."
bnyak kalahnya
Chelsea players have their heads already in another club I think many will leave the club in the end of the season due to this situation
"The Algerian national team was unjustly wronged in the match that brought it together with the Cameroonian team, due to the Gambian referee Gassama, who was against Algeria and prevented it from participating in the World Cup.  The Algerian people are asking FIFA to reconsider the outcome of the match because the arbitration disasters affected the result."
"They scored and go to the manger like they are wining the primer league, then they ate 4 😂😂😂😂😂😂 how small they are"
As an LFC fan this gives me the same vibes from the Watford3-0Liverpool game a couple seasons ago
There was no passion There was no aggression There was no energy
Chelsea Fans at different timeline:<br>First 3 Games: Racing for EPL title 🤩<br>Half Season: We can still do it 😙<br>February: Top 3 and defending UCL 🥺<br>Now: 😭😭😭
3rd goal from brendford is really good. Same with Rudigers
XD juego fifa 22 y con este partido mi eriksen de 90 subió 2 de glb
"Replace the goalkeeper, because now he has the curse of the pharaohs"
Hhhhhhhhh 1_4😂😂😂😂😂
Diobok obok
The limbs for Brentford’s goals were insane
Without roman abramovic. Chelsea is nothing
"Fantastic Goals from Chelsea , Rudiger kick very dangerous"
Small club
Wtf is wrong with the defense?
"Bye, Chelsea"
Im here after the Madrid defeat.... and thiago needs to be checked.... he committing himself too much...most of the goals scored he commits himself
mulai membadut chealse wwkkwkwk
Salam 3_1
"If you just play like this, Chelsea will be left with the neighboring club🤔😥"
Л Е П О Т А ! ! ! 😅🤣🤦‍♂️
I&#39;m frozen 😨😨😨
only thing that lacked in Rudiger&#39;s goal: ceremony
This is so embsra...g.....
keren banget
I&#39;m only here for Rudiger&#39;s goal the rest can miss me.
Eriksen!!!
Parabéns meu amigo 💙💙
super play
"I just remember what tuchel said , I will build a team and no one will want to play against"
It’s a shame that we lost
Bruh the Brentford team decided to score one goal for every year that Rudiger has been trying to net that long shot
"Rüdiger best shoot ,best player,best long goal"
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Rudiger’s wonderful goal is offset by his careless assist. Do hope all of teammates can devote 100% concentration in the coming games.
Gool gool yg indah... Mantaf betuulll
Mendy blunder 😡
will beat with real madaril fall  wanna go chelsea win kind
"Hahaha kocak sekali pertandingan ini, kalah lawan tim gurem"
A disaster! Brentford deserved
Real madrid vous attend le gac
Luar biasa gool
Pls get new rb lb &amp; cmf. Alonslow &amp; loftuscheek out
that&#39;s a horrible show of defending. congrats to eriksen. he get his grip back to the game
"Челси без Абрамовича всё, не челси"
4 years rudiger waited and he lost 4 1
"What a goal ,good result for Brendford"
Real madrid 4 - 1 chelsea
챌시..꺼저라!!&quot;사람이냐??..ㅜㅜㅜ4대1이뭐냐???개실망..
Celsi keok
My Chelsea is my life 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
This absolutely an acceptable result.
I can&#39;t believe it...
Chelsea
What a team.. Very much appreciated
🤣🤣🤣🤩🤣🤣🤣Rudigaa🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
"needs to set up a team to investigate, how do you lose against Brentford at home by 4 goals (not Man City/Liv)! and you are going to play against RM next, why even bother playing, just take some rest"
Это пизд
Hahahahhaa goblok
"boring, sad"
Eriksen 🤩
NEXT TIME
Very poor quality video
Don&#39;t celebrate too soon.
Please we don&#39;t like seeing these kind of clips <br>Why not cut out rudigers goal and the celebration then maybe post the brentford goals for those who want to see it?🙄😒
Defending?

"Calling it now, southgate will start with hernderson int he euros.<br><br>And put bellingham in goal.<br><br>Calling it right now."
Yeah can&#39;t wait 4 the euros Bellingham on fire 🔥
Unreal. It&#39;s not even news anymore - 6 months ago the world would have been going nuts at a performance like this
why naooly 3 goal off side and rma 2nd was on side cheat. not 3-2 2-2 when the 19 year score
2nd goal off side.yes yes yes it&#39;s a cheat
&quot;Almost saying sorry with his hands in pray mode&quot;? More like thank f for that?
Bellingham one of the best mids in the world now becoming a complete midfielder
RM have found their new CR7
They can win the champions league this year easy
I predict big things for Jude Bellingham.

"Dare I say it, Bellingham giving Zidane vibes! Theres a reason hes wearing number 5"
that pass by alaba was class btw to assist bellingham
Petition to just make Jude Bellingham a CF
"Surely he must eye international success, which is the only way to become a true footballing legend"
"Do Real actually have any strikers, because Bellingham seems to be the only person in the box half the time. ?"
I&#39;m glad Rodriguez is scoring aswell since Benzemas departure. <br>champions league winners?
"If Real Madrid could be a national team ,they could world champions"
The football iq of Jude Bellinghams assist 😮‍💨
who tf is this joselu trying to be benzema???? and he tried to be ronaldo copying bycicle kicks but failed and landed on his arse
FFS so Bellingham can head the ball as well ??  The boy is something else
Proud he is a Brummie ❤😂
Jude Bellingham proves how he is a Real Madrid signing once again if he was around 15-20 years ago he would be a galactico no problem
That pass on the last goal 👌🏽
Best thing real Madrid did was sign Bellingham wow what a player
Balloon dor lockdown already my guy Bellingham
To go to two different countries with such confidence and so young is unreal
"He IS special, n I&#39;ve watched a LOT of football over the years ."
People who think Bellingham&#39;s gonna be the future goat <br>👇
Osimhen standing so blatantly offside is worrying from a chelsea fans perspective
Real Madrids young players Going crazy nahhh
"Everyone posting completely over-the-top praise for Bellingham, and it&#39;s all 100% deserved. That assist with the outside of the boot in the 93rd min. Yikes."
Keeper should save the one for 3-2 all day Napoli would&#39;ve probably got a result if he did
What?! No mention that Madrid’s 3rd goal was a goalkeeping mistake?! If that was Onana….
"Ancelottis reaction when Joselu finally scores at the end is pretty amazing, what a manager 👏🏾"
£100m is looking a right bargain.  Bellingham just does everything.
Great stuff from Bellingham but he’s just started. Let’s not get carried away I see people in the comments comparing him to Pele 😂. Relax guys. He has to do it season in season out for a long period of time. Right now let’s just enjoy his football and not state outlandish stuff.
"I always thought Bellingham was overhyped and Madrid made the wrong choice in buying him but boy was I wrong, dude is smart and gifted! What a performance and player! Wait till they buy Mbappe :O"
Jude had an excellent game but why were all the other Real Madrid strikers trying to do a Garnacho overhead kick
Why everyone tryna recreate the goal
Jude Bellingham is doin up New Star Soccer in real life 😂<br><br>It’s too easy for him
Madrid the REAL deal.
I don&#39;t know any English player that&#39;s reached at heights playing for a foreign team at such a young age the world is oyster this could be one of the greatest English players of all time Bellingham 👍
Legendary night at the Santiago Bernabeu
What a player Jude is
Unpopular opinion... I think Rodrygo is better on the left than Vini is
Joselu 😑😑😑
Immense player.
"Jonathan Pearce so slow on the commentary, he is a play by play commentator ...he needs to build excitement....can TNT give him some honest feedback please?"
Nico pas .. what a strike from him 👏
Alaba learnt very well from modric
"I mean....how good is Bellingham?? Crazy watching him last night. Touch is class, can finish, can pass.  Goal and assist, created plenty and never stopped running.  What a unit."
Bellingham&#39;s last assist unreal!
"Jude is getting at least 30 goals this season with the way he’s been playing! Hopefully he keeps fit. Best player in the world rn, plays effortlessly."
Title should be jude helps inspire but cause he&#39;s English jude inspires  even though rodrygo got first goal
"What a ball for the fourth goal, surprised the commentators didn’t make a bigger noise."
Jude is reminding of Owen when he was 18/20 and he was killing it at liverpool...if jude stays fit all season he is going set even more levels than he has already
joselu is the darwin of la liga
"That was poor from alaba he should of know better, my man was day dreaming lol"
What boots was Bellingham wearing? 👁 👁
Sad not to see Modrić involved
Questions about Real defensively.
Everyone is talking about Bellingham and I know he is insane right now but I feel we need to give Rodrygo some respect. He is playing brilliantly filling in for vini and I think he could go on to score a ton more goals by the end of the season👏👏👏
Rodrygo is a monster.
Should have shown Bellingham in midfield before the last goal. Not only did he get the assist but he started the whole move!
When bellingham scored it made the score 1-1 it was meant to be 2-0
I wish Bellingham played for Newcastle 😞
Bellingham ... english machine !
"If RM had better forwards, Belllingham would have had four assists in this match. What really stood out for me was Bellingham&#39;s run for his goal. He was unmarked because of his vision to run into the space for the cross. This is his &#39;footballing intelligence&#39; which is the key to his goalscoring success."
"If Jude keeps going at this rate and Real win the champions league, the Ballon d’or will have his name on it 🫡"
Jude is playing well for real Madrid but let&#39;s not go all topsy turvy about him too soon.
I liked it when everyone tried topping Garnacho with failed overheads 😂
Hey Jude. ♥️🇬🇧
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBb-APEud8o&amp;t=0m53s"">0:53</a> that is a dirty challenge on Bellingham....ironically he could have blocked the shot if not for that."
the amount of bicycle kicks everybody’s trying since Garnacho is hilarious 😂
nice to see ferland mendy play. 💯💪🏿
Where is kepa
"Rodrygo gone up a level recently…I’m impressed. And Bellingham is just well, Bellingham."
Bellingham and Kane showing English players can be amazing abroad
Let’s make everything about Bellingham because he’s English 😂 if he was Brazilian no one would’ve heard his hame
True story with Jude Bellingham. What a journey……and it’s only just started
best player in the world at the moment
That no.99 for napoli looks like a fifa pro clubs player. No. 21 for Real Madrid looks promising. Brilliant talent on ball
Jude is the definition of world class. Generational baller

What a comeback 👏
did not show the final post from Inter
"Man alive, that curse isn’t going anywhere"
"Why is number 19 not mentioned ONCE by the commentator, and Mario was congratulated numerous times when he just finished what no19 started off with hard work, for EVERY goal?"
No penalty ref is poor
Another bad decision for the red card here.
At the end inter was taking over
"That red card was so strange. To me its clear yellow card. Yes, its late and aggresive but come on, this is football, not softball."
I know Utd blundered a 2 goal lead but a 3 goal lead 😂 That&#39;s absolutely shocking 😂😂😂
Didn&#39;t the flag go up on the first goal or am I been dumb?
How did inter end up with Sanchez and mkhitaryan 😂🤷🏾‍♂️ both ex Arsenal &amp; Man Utd players part of the swap deal
"No Grimaldo, no party....."
That must be the ugliest  hat-trick ever...three mis-hits three goals
Lol Sporting youth player carry Benfica.
That&#39;s never a red. Soft as butter that is.
"Has everyone forgotten Inter was starting 8 of their subs in this game? Immediate impact from Thuram in the second half. And even Lautaro has just played the final 10 minutes of the game. They would have won it if Barella&#39;s strike hadn&#39;t hit the post. That&#39;s differences between these two teams, both mentality and ability."
Joao mario 3 goals at 33 minutes
That penalty is absolutely hilarious. Football is becoming a joke
"Dogshit decision for the penalty, should have been a yellow for simulation, fcking embarrassing."
Today is when I found out that Arnautovic and Sanchez played for Inter
"More tactical from serie a, legs go longer ,run wen needed"
3 golos e brulhados .... mas foram golos .
How on earth is that a red? There&#39;s gonna be 5 reds a game if this is the standard being set for the future
hmm... not a penalty and not a red
Commentators like pro evo 5 lol
What they dont show in this video is the foul on Neves before the Pen was given
my di maria rttk 😭
Christ almighty! Never a penalty or a sending off🤦‍♂️!??? The Officials are doing this on purpose for all the years of abuse! -  It&#39;s the only explanation surely🤔🤷‍♂️!
Happy for Sanchez didn’t work at that dead club Man Utd but no one has thrived their last 6 years anyway. Sanchez was INCREDIBLE at Arsenal will always have love for him 🙏
Never a pen
😂😂😂 love to see it 😂😂<br>Poor Portuguese 😢
Officiating standards in football these days are absolutely abysmal.<br><br>Most ridiculous things as the lino flagging for offside when he was clearly unsighted by the player stood in front!<br><br>They’re all just guessing now.
I thought Sanchez scored or something
Has to be the scrapiest worst hat trick iv ever seen
Poor refereeing.
I swear every season joao Mario has 1 performance like this
That red card is outrageous- game’s gone
Never seen a player so sure he was onside
"The linesman raises the flag for every goal, it&#39;s a joke😂😂"
BENFICA 🦅was robbed of a victory 😏
"Football as we know it,  is fini"
Alexis sanchez should not have gone to utd that was a big mistake considering he could have been one of the top players itw in his prime
"No chance that was a penalty, cmon WTF haha"
This is why Inter and City were the UCL finalist last season. Just different mentality. Mentality decided everything.
Alexis looks skinny now. He was really bulked back then
Beşiktaş : 3 Benfica :3  🖤🤍
What a game
How was that a penalty for Thuram? 😂😂😂
"haven&#39;t heard worse commentary in a while, absolutely dire and lifeless"
Quando os arbitros não sao Padres ou toupeiras mafiosos fica mais dificil ganhar 🤔 um treinador que não falava de Arbitros 🤔🤡 agora esta a mostrar a sua verdadeira face 😈 o Benficamafia uma equipa vulgar fraca ridicula para andar na Liga dos Campeoes 🤔😱 tem que pagar aos arbitros na liga dos Campeoes como fazem no campeonato Portugues 🇵🇹🤔🤬🤡
No highlight of barella shot on the post??
Benfica once again were robed against INTER even with Var referees can manipulate games! the mistakes cannot benefit always the same team! Some of this champions league games should be investigated by the police!!!
"How is that a flipping red, what is going on with the game this season???  Saying its lost it way is an understatement! Lawmakers need to have serious re-think otherwise fans and players just getting p1ssed off all the time, every game. Not enjoyable anymore"
Wow I thought we had a bad night with Galatasaray
Considering Inzaghi rested a lot of the first team its a good performance
Italian sport journalists before this weeks games: &quot;It is good that Mats Hummels is playing against Milan. Right now Acerbi is better than Hummels&quot;<br>Hummels: Hold my beer<br>Acerbi: Hold my Spritz
I can&#39;t believe alexis sanchez is still playing seems like about 20yr ago he was failing miserably at united lmfao he must be about 40 lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Soft af pen
Benfica 🤝Man United 🤝 Sevilla <br>             Bottlejobs             FC
Never a penalty and never a red card. Benfica have been cheated by the officials here
Benfica rlly bottled a 3 goal lead inter are cheats tho and that was never a red benfica player got the ball var and refs are trash nowadays...
If only Alexis didn’t go Manchester united
Love it when benfica drop points
3_3
Sanchez
Where is the fault highlight on the other side before the 3rd goal?
So VAR sent him to the monitor for the red card tackle but not the penalty where he clearly got the ball? Amazing. Just amazing.
"Barella hits the crossbar at extra time ,but because this is an English Tv ,they will not show in highlights 😠"
"Crazy game, crazy Inter, we don&#39;t play easy games, never, that&#39;s why we love our outstanding nerazzurri team, finally Marko and Alexis scored for Inter, if we&#39;d started better in the first half, maybe the outcome would&#39;ve been different, but that&#39;s alright, Sunday&#39;s game is more important than last night one, always and only Forza Inter forever 🖤 💙 G"
So many referees commenting on the penalty. Wonder why they’re not in the job.
"Had a good laugh at that red card it was an obvious yellow, what has the game come to 😂"
No way thats a pen!
Inter fired its engines in the second half and even a second team were over Benfica!.
Joao Mario scored a hattrick in 33 minutes against his former club. Brilliant
"Plays the ball and var thinks it’s a penalty, yellow card tackle then the same referees checking the monitor decide that it’s a red .<br><br>Uefa and Fifa might want them for the next Major competitions , the level of refereeing have gone down since  World Cup 2014.<br><br>Most of the “best” referees are at 2nd division level , just look at the past two World Cups."
"Commentary : “ he scored against is own club “<br><br>I mean Joao Mario was sold it’s not his club. And they kept saying the same 😂<br><br>That red card and penalty were a disgrace. Completely wrong. <br><br>Also seen people commenting that everyone is against Benfica in this season well I don’t think so unfortunately for Benfica was unfair that penalty, completely wrong but the rest of the CL games it’s on them they just couldn’t play good. So no one is against Benfica it’s their own fault."
The Rangers* will have to rely on that 8 goal winning margin for Barça after all.
Sanchez Arsenal reunion?😉
2 days in a row matches have been rigged by penalties. CL is finished.
Sachez playing must be old video😄
"Defo a red card, late, over the ball and out of control."
We gave benfica hope by not starting regular players then took it away 😂 Forza Inter 🖤💙
Never a red card 👎
"13 years between goals, got to be a record?"
Very soft penalty. Hate to see these given
"Crazy that VAR was brought in to overrule terrible decisions like the penalty and the red card, yet now it’s actually having the opposite effect. What a shambles 🤦‍♂️"
"Never a penalty, never a red card. The CL Gods are against Benfica this season"
Wait is the guy from F2 working for benfica now?
Unbelievable penalty given. How on earth did this ref give that
Red card was harsh. But more importantly penalty should not be given. He clearly takes the ball. Benfica robbed off their first win. NEUTRAL GALATASARAY FAN HERE :)
I don&#39;t understand this game anymore. That is not a red card also the pen was not a pen. But well VAR coming on to ruin the game
Pen was soft &amp; that was not a red .
Istanbul 2005 Bollywood edition
There were 2 clear referee mistakes.<br>The penalty is not a penalty as the Benfica defender quicks the ball and is Inter striker that goes against the legs of the Benfica defender as he could not stop running. <br>The direct sent off of the Benfica defender is too severe as a yellow card should be the right decision.There was no aggression from the Benfica defender as he just wanted to play the ball.<br>Very bad referring and when is on a champions league game it is total unacceptable. Benfica was robbed of a clear victory. 😮
Two strikers nearing 35 and one of thems Arnautović. inter are getting knocked out next stage for sure.
How on earth is that a penalty?
That was never a penalty or a red card
"Another interesting game tonight, not a red though"
Amazing comeback but that was not a penalty nor a red card.<br>Two stupid decisions as usual 😮
Moronic decision for the red card.

What a game
he was the problem
But Ronaldo was the problem …..
BOTB!
Harry maguire’s boots made him good
"This Man Utd was better than what we are seeing now , Ten hag is killing the team 😢"
And people say he was the problem.
Can’t believe last year we were watching Cr7 do this for United 😂☕️
Ronnie was right
The day Ronaldo saved Maguire
I know he ended not on the best terms but... i am proud to say i took my dad to his first Old Trafford game and he saw Cristiano Ronaldo score a hat trick. one of my fondest memories i&#39;ll cherish forever with my dad ❤
"I cried that day, what a legend 🥹"
Show me Messi scoring HatTrick in PL against top team at this age…I will call him goat myself 🤫🤭
The greatest of all time
United should have built around Ronaldo instead of letting Eric Ten Hag bin him.
"This is my premier league game of all time. Masterclass from Ronaldo, Old Trafford buzzing, drama, tension, it had everything!"
"Best player I&#39;ve ever seen, and to do it for all those years in so many different leagues!  beautiful footballer"
Can we give City Maguire for free?
"What a mistake to let Ronaldo go., he has done so much for Manchester United. The way he was treated by fans ,  the Clubs and the U.K. media was disgraceful."
Ten fraud
ranoldo scord. the. goal
Ronaldo and Kane both now left the PL
Ronaldo vs spurs ☠️
🐐 things
As much as Maguire annoys us all with his OG we need to have some respect towards him ❤
The problem
The No.7❤
HARRY MAGUIRE
"So much respect when Man United re-signed Ronaldo, and so much disrespect when he left... Long live the king"
"Whos here after we lost 2-0 to spurs, ronaldo clearly was never the problem single handedly destroyed spurs all by himself with a hatrick and yet this team eth is building cant even score 1 goal as a team 😴"
Who else came bck for this reminder since they got 2-0 from Tottenham 2023
proves without a real striker  most of the time you wont win  atleast ronaldo clutched that time but we dint even have proper striker playing
Who&#39;s here after Spus battered United 2-0?
and he was the &quot;problem&quot; - Media
ronaldo the GOAT ALWAYS MESSI IS RUBBISH
I got to watch him play so I don’t care what  nobody says my eyes don’t lie this guy is an animal 🦁 🐅 🎯
His third goal is biblical.
We will surely miss Ronaldo at Man U 😩
Harry maguire is so bab
Sewi
"If I talk, big trouble"
🐐🐐
Liors is stupid at golekepping like he is a baby at gollkeeping
Still can’t believe Ronaldo pulled this off 😂
The goat doing goat things. Easy
Maguire had to score as well
don&#39;t know why utd got rid of him
A preview to man United. Ronaldo saving them and Maguire setting them back
He is the second 🐐
Now Newcastle is beating united 😂 ronaldo problem right
🐐
But Ronaldo was the problem 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
GOAT MOMNET
...miss him
OMG its Daniel Cutting
Once when I was a 6 year old I did the first Ronaldo goal
What Messi still goat
Ronaldo W Messi L
Weghorst might be the worst downgrade ever
Ronoldo had enough and just headed it !what a hatrick
what a finish messi never do that
is this when Cristiano Ronaldo did a 119km an hour shot
😢
Pomero deserved that humbling for screaming at Maguires face
I know it didn’t last long his 2nd spell but moments like this one made it worth him being back for a little bit
yes
Some of us will never forget how great he is. Sometimes a player and team just no longer fit.
Maguire owngoaled
The people in this stadium witnessed an absolutely spectacular ronaldo performance this was the Ronaldo show at the theatre of dreams
So close de hea penalty
what a goal from Ronaldo
Harry Maguire 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Can someone tell me how a &#39;washed up&#39; player scored a hat trick? Why did they get rid of him?
"Bro wtf with the people hating on Ronaldo bc of him going to another league, like just have a look, this man was class 10-9 month ago and oc still. Can&#39;t blame him, just glad we have the opportunity to watched it live."
Suuuuuuuuu
they did him dirty
He single-handedly saved them numerous times from the champions league games on their group that season and got them to the knockout stages of the champions league and not to mention helping them finish in a Europa league spot. Without him they would’ve finished mid table in the league and crashed out of group stage too. In my opinion he deserves a statue outside Old Trafford he really is the GOAT and the way how the club and the fans have disrespected him and turned on him is criminal
People forget how much he did on his return. Utd fans are disgraceful
How quickly people forget...
I don’t see how in less than a season they stopped trusting a GOAT
And now he is hated. Shows what stories and fickle human brains can do. Legend irrespective.
Watching Man Utd without Ronaldo now is like experiencing your first Christmas after finding out Santa doesn&#39;t exist.  Somehow the magic has gone.
sorry but Ronaldo was bigger than the club at this point. united totally disrespected him. his last moments at united were sabotaged.
"miss u Ronaldo, U r forever star of Manchester United"
utd actually ruined this man
60 hat tricks Legend
Does a player really go from scoring 18 League goals in a season to nothing? The amount of disrespect this man has gotten is crazy. There will never be another Ronaldo 😔
Unbelievable
What a goal amazing we love ronaldo 7
"i refuse to belive that THIS is gone, just like that. no way. He needs to do a proper farewell season. too much personal tragedie and dramas."
23
Sui boy got 99 over all
Who boy
Then ten hag comes in and stopped all that momentum 😞
Lucky Mancs 😂
CAN HE JUST COME BACK AGAIJ ALREADY 😢🥺
Ronaldo is legend ❤
Ronaldo is the goat and always will be stupid united fans have forgotten what he has done for the club
A legend be will long remain!
As a Real Madrid fan it’s a shame how Manchester United has treated this legend.

Well done Copenhagen !
"That red card is an absolute disgrace, never is that a sending off. What has football become"
Love Copenhagen ❤️✌️👏👏
👍
"Fair play Copenhagen, I doubt many people predicted they&#39;d get to the knockouts"
"As a gala fan , respect to Copenhagen well deserved"
"It&#39;s great to see the underdogs make it to the knockout stages, a shame this time it wasn&#39;t to be for Manchester United and Copenhagen made it through"
"As a Galatasaray fan, I would like to congratulate Copenhagen. They played very well and their fans were crazy, and they even managed to go ahead of Man U AND us. Fair play 👏👏👏👏👏"
"Rakow Czestochowa from Poland was more challenging rival for FC Copenhagen than Man.UTD, what a story, what a crazy results of real football, not from media circus market."
That white wall of support 😮 true dedication to the club!
Yanited 🤣🤣🤣
As a United fan am happpy galatasray went to Europe 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What a great achievement for Copenhagen Football Club. I don’t think anyone thought they’d win a single game in the beginning and they ended up qualifying
Vinland saga
WOW Gala are such a small team nowadays.
"Congratulations to Copenhagen, they fully deserved their win 👏👏"
don’t know what will be crazier this or newcastle if we go through
"Ngl, when this group came out I thought Bayern and Utd will make the knockouts and Galatasaray Europa. But great achievement by Copenhagen to make the UCL knockout stages."
As  longest Turks did not go through
Copenhagen fans doing Skyrim dragons shouts as chants 🤣
Glory  Glory  Man Utd As The Reds Go Marching OUT....
As a Galatasaray fan I could say that Copenhagen fully deserved to win the game absolutely well played
"People will talk about how bad United were in this group and rightly so, but the fact Copenhagen managed to finish ahead of Galatasaray and United and reach the knockouts is an incredible story."
LETS LAUGH AT MANCHESTER UNITED🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Galatasaray might be out of the Champions League but at least they&#39;ll have Europa League in the new year, unlike a certain team from Manchester."
Needed galatasary to score for £870 😡
Bet they&#39;ll get Man City in the Round of 16.
Yesss Copenhagen- What a tough team to beat. As a Liverpool fan i&#39;m so happy😊
Well deserved ! They showed a lot of fight unlike the team that finished 4th 😅
"for Copenhagen to get second in this group is massive, players played their hearts out"
Copenhagen&#39;s resilience and togetherness remind me of Denmark&#39;s Euro 2020 run
Fair play🤝🏼<br>Definitely more deserving to qualify than the joke team man united
Lets all laugh at Yanited! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

"How&#39;s trossard not able to score that Lmao💀💀😫😫😂😂😫 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPK3AKLmYk0&amp;t=3m16s"">3:16</a>"
Bloody hell forgot about Elneny!!
"Some fans on here saying Arsenals second should have counted, Gabi interfered with play, as much as I would like the automated offside to be shown, it’s offside"
We REALLY need Cms.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPK3AKLmYk0&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a> Ramsdale wasn&#39;t beaten he tipped it onto the post"
Bakayoko is some player man would mind signing him as back up to Saka or to push him
Not sure why Gabriel is given offside when the only person he interferes with is Kiwor 🫠
&quot;ramsdale was beaten&quot; he just saved  it off the damn post
Finding ways to disallow goals again
Saliba and gabriel today 🔥
"‘Eddie Nketiah, instinctive. That’s what he was all about.’ Joey Barton was right."
Very poor defending from saliba
Well done PSV for getting the equaliser.
We should of played better and won and Eddie and Nelson and Cedric and more needs to be sold in January
ramsdale was beaten ? he saved it dimwit😂
This clown got beaten twice by Unia Emery with two different teams
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPK3AKLmYk0&amp;t=2m37s"">2:37</a> ramsdale tipped it onto the post"
Bring back ramsdale
Why was kiwor goal disallowed💀💀💀
The header wasnt offside <br>Gabriel didnt touch the ball
TH14 goal from psv 😮
Ramsdale IN 🫡🙌🏼
Not gonna lie Ramsdale is shocking 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I dont know what it is with trossard sometimes he looks like he doesnt want to be there and loses the ball or does a bad pass
"If only he did pass that ball to No 14, that would have been another story. Egoistic"
EDDIE
"Elneny only scores bangers 😂 if that shot off the post had gone in, it would&#39;ve been another to add to the collection"
The save was so good the commentator had to say he was beaten. He couldn&#39;t believe it because it&#39;s not often keepers make world class reactions like that.
Nonsense match just t complete group  with many debutants; I&#39;ll take the draw an move onto Brighton
"Haven’t seen an Arsenal keeper make a save like Ramsdale’s since… Ramsdale. Raya never ever saves anything he shouldn’t, the goal at Villa was right at him just needed to stand tall, but Allison won Liverpool 2 points at Palace put them top and that’s why we will lose the competitions we’re in this season because Arteta won’t see he’s wrong until it’s too late"
pepi and tillman usa players running rings around ENGCLOWN PREM PLAYERS
Kiwiors goal should have stood in my opinion
"Confused why Kiwior goal disallowed, he was clearly onside and keeper just completely misjudged his punch. Didn&#39;t interfere with him at all, ball was already clearly past keeper before he was even close to Gabriel..."
Okay it doesn’t really matter whether they win or lose they have overwhelmingly qualified for the next round. I suppose they have to go through the process that might influence who could possibly qualify with them. Not that it matters for Arsenal fans.
Ramsdale got the slightest of touches and goal should have stood
Finish by Eddie 👏🏿👏🏿
"Glad ramsdale finally made a well deserved champions league appearance. He is one of the reasons we are in the competition and his treatment over Raya has been awful by arteta. I wish Eddie scored in games when it matters as he has been pretty absent for some time now, needs to prove why we don’t need to seek a striker in the transfer window"
Bottlenal
Trossard is a criminal but squaring to Nketiah. Same as Nketiahs crime a few weeks back.
So disagree with the comment below this !
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPK3AKLmYk0&amp;t=2m33s"">2:33</a> Not offside, absolutely shocking decision, but that&#39;s nothing new against Arsenal, despite the game being meaningless."
I’m not sure how Arsenal’s second goal was an offside. I think that was Kiwior’s goal. And he was on
Ramsdale is a better keeper than Raya.
Where ramsdale save
elneny is actually amazing at long shots. so unlucky to hit the post.
Arsenal are falling apart already 😂
Playing saliba and Gabriel come on bruv give them a rest knowing we’re topping the group regardless of todays result and the fact that we’ve got a couple of big games coming up too
Well done Kiwior
That should of been a full 11 rested right before the busy Xmas period would of made sense the game was a dead game would of made more sense to give game time to all the fringe/ young academy players knocking on the 1st team’s locker room
👍🏻
they got unlucky
Trossard getting greedy. 2 chances to pass to Nketiah for an easy finish. Could have been 3-1.
Trossard really isn’t in form at the moment!😢
"I think the selection and the subs used in this game were needless from Arteta. I’ve no idea why he’s against playing the youngsters in a game like this. I genuinely believe that if Saka was in the U-21’s when Arteta joined us, he’d be nowhere near as established as he is now"
"As a Chelsea fan,im really scared now, arsenal could win the champions league 😢"
Kiwior destroyed 😂😂 good game tho
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPK3AKLmYk0&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a> Ramsdale wasn’t beaten? He got a touch onto the post even after the deflection?"
Eddie is still garbage
Ramsdale proving why he should be number 1. No idea what Arteta sees in Raya
"Why did Gabriel hold off so much for there goal he should of gone across and closed down the defender, school boy defending"
Where is Nwaneri all now? Arteta really is allergic to youth development 🤒
‘Ramsdale was beaten’ - it was an incredible reaction save onto the post! The Ramsdale hate continues
"I don&#39;t know why Arteta isn&#39;t being praised for not being dog sh*t bad in the group stage, like Manchester United &amp; Newcastle United 🤣🤣😘😘"
The woodwork saw more action that game than I do most years!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPK3AKLmYk0&amp;t=2m25s"">2:25</a> the save and reaction time by ramsdale is crazy"
should’ve played at least ONE academy player. has Arteta given any a chance in his career?
"Happy with a draw, won the group hopefully no injuries to key players"
Players who do the Shhh celebration end up losing or drawing the game. No arsenal player should be doing that celebration.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPK3AKLmYk0&amp;t=2m29s"">2:29</a> do they not realise ramsdale tipped it onto the post ?"
"Happy Ramsdale got his debut finally and Eddie scored his first Champion&#39;s league goal. Was also pretty impressed by Nelson, Arteta has got to give him more of a chance in the league."
Oh no
Reiss Nelson should be trusted more by Arteta. Great finish from Eddie. Lord please help Smith Rowe to stay injury free. Amen.
Reiss nelson MOTM. Deserves more gametime.
WILLIAM SALIBABA!!! What a tackle.
i watched the match and ramsdale and elneny performed rlly well hope they get some more mins
Elneny still being at Arsenal is mid-boggling. Only the player still left from the Wenger days
Oh mama Shri
Rambo was better tonight
Good result for our B team
w
Lovely from psv to qualify for the ro16
Hopefully now Arsenal can whinge about something in this game rather than being beaten by Villa.
Bakayoko what a talent 🔥
"After a very long time, was not bothered about a result in Europe 🤣🤣🤣"
Player who headed Arsenal’s 2nd wasn’t offside!  What’s going on here?
Arsenal in europe is pure banter
early
Even the 2nd choice team miss chances get practicing boys!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPK3AKLmYk0&amp;t=0m15s"">0:15</a> what a tackle by Saliba!"
trossard should have passed to eddie score would be 2-1 smh
Arsenal will not win the ucl. Imagine not getting 18 points in a mickey mouse group 😂😂😂
This jus proves nd shows our Squad depth  is really poor
1 hour gang
Don’t know why Arteta isn’t playing some of the academy players in this game. It means nothing
Arsenal happy that they&#39;ve avoided Bayern in the knockout last 16 😂
W group stage for Arsenal COYG
That Bakayoko looks a player. Ripped us tonight
Glad we are though to the Round of 16 hopefully we can reach far in the ucl COYG

If we see the Lukaku&#39;s tackle we understand because fowars score goals and centre-backs defend. Each player have a position.
"Лукака нуждается в дисквалификации! Это больше, чем красная. Так играть просто нельзя!"
Шлюхаху опять забил? 😄

Lukaku is crazy you can see the rip from the players socks when he came in with studs! Imagine it was planted? That would’ve been game over for him

Vamooooos Roma❤

Jawohl Florenz 😊👍⚽️
2 red card 1-1 amazing as roma. No bad
That was a red card every day of the week.<br>Lukaku knows better.
"Well it was fun to watch while it lasted, but now Dybala is injured, and thus ends Roma&#39;s little winning streak."
⚽👏🏻👏🏻
Dybala is ghosted forever.
Forza Bologna
Not the Mour approach. Roma fortunate to get a point n  should have known better impact of losing one player in the game moreover two where they won at Sassulo last week playing against 10 men.
That tackle was so unneccessary
Note always bet over 3.5 for cards in this game 😂
roma without dybala are horrible
"from hero to zero. still inconsistent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23poorluka"">#poorluka</a>"
Trivial.
"Lukaku should get a 10 match suspension for that, disgusting."
Lukaku like amator player
Lukaku why ??
"What a shameful team as roma is. They should get 7 red cards every single match. Awful defensive football, constant complaining about referees… a disgusting team."

"This highlights seem biased to me. So if Nigeria had not scored, we would not have seen any moves from them ?"
I don’t understand why they were so aggressive about taking the ball from Pickford.. Like three of them surrounded him.
Nigeria 🇳🇬❤️
I&#39;m from England and Nigeria soooo.....Umm I wanted it to be a draw
When will he have kit that amazing
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOctLZf1kkE&amp;t=1m48s"">1:48</a> England fans booing Dele Alli?"
England deserved that win
You suck england
For ppl saying that dele all i dad left him he did not so i suggest u read his background story very well then come comment on his life and as a person who has the same background as him but being born and raised in England but my dad came from Nigeria i toatlly get where he is coming from but idc wat team he plays for its his life and none of are business oh and seriously these ppl need to stop throwing shade at  sterling
I feel so sorry for Dele
Alex Iwobi Rejects England Footballer because of his Native Country Nigeria HERO
Alex Iwobi...<br>I&#39;m proud of you.<br>Can&#39;t stop thinking about that stunning goal honestly...
Grande Harry kane
Any one from bd🇧🇩💙😇
Alex Iwobi Man of the match
and so am i
dele alli is nigerian
I love you england
Come on England. Great video!
i was lucky enough to go to Wembley and watch it
"I love Sterling,he&#39;s brilliant. Not once have i seen him lose that ball in the back if the net. Pure class."
"The pass from Kane at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOctLZf1kkE&amp;t=3m34s"">3:34</a> is Pirlo-esque."
Kane should have done this against Croatia instead of putting it wide.
You should show the lineups before the highlights start !!!!!!!
I was there
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=631W_ga1LK8"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=631W_ga1LK8</a>"
england vs brazil will be the best final but it is just my opinion...
Welbeck and Ali should be in Nigeria team too
England those show offs
Why can&#39;t Dele Alli accept his Nigerian. Smh
Rashford over Sterling
England&#39;s biggest downfall will be same as always a midfield incapable of controlling an dictating a game. Henderson Dier is one of the weakest midfield pairings England have had since probably Graham Taylor. England have pace an will prob score goals but they want have a midfield to take the steam out the game when Infront or give them some respite from running around like headless chickens
The carthagians  🇹🇳 will  win England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿  the First Match
poor goalkeeping . ugh where is peter rufai when u need him
what happens with delle alli???
That was a nice goal iwuobi.Godluck
"Nigeria was totally rubbish in this game, the players were so sloppy, slow, and totally useless"
"Nigeria will win the world cup, the hard way, but they will. Its a very good but underrated team."
Those England kits are clean.
What a beautiful jersey!
Croatia Nigeria 4-0
decent game
"Deluded Nigerians booing a player who dosnt care about their shithole country nor has he ever lived there, he was born and raised here so why would he play for a country who he qualifies to play for through his dad he hates? <br><br>Plus it&#39;s a bit hypocritical when all them Nigerians ditched their country to come and live here so aernt they as bad ?"
There is no better platform to shine in da world of football then WC...Harry Kane if u belong in that bracket.The time has come.....Let&#39;s find out who he is n who he isn&#39;t.
what the hell was pickford doing when iwobi scored he didnt give him the ball what a loser pickford
Uzoho was a op goalkeeper that match
Is anybody going to Volgograd or NN? Looking for somebody to meet and kill some time since I&#39;m going to those games alone.
Hahaha Nigeria vs Argentina alternative 4
Hardly a White man on the pitch.
"Sterling can’t finish without the truly world class foreign players around him, no decent centre half’s, young unknown keeper, know proper left winger, one <br>dimensional tactics, joke of a manager . Roll on the World Cup"
What happened to Nigeria&#39;s highlights in the first half?
I was there no lie
"England are no longer england, it is a team of Africans with British passports."
They should give all African players a one time option to opt out of their European national team play for their homeland. Majority came under duress and manipulation by their desperate parents (can’t blame them). Majority fled from war and poverty. If they could I bet they would opt out . They get abuse like sterling is all the time. Look at balotelli. They are not appreciated in Europe.
"Alex Iwobi is very loyal.He could have played for England like Dele Alli,but he chose to play for his home country Nigeria."
get a HD camera and learn to render
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOctLZf1kkE&amp;t=1m12s"">1:12</a> LOL      masa lompatnya blakangan wkwkw"
Free Tommy Robinson!<br>This should be sang all the time during world cup games by brittish football fans.
England had a ton in the box
England will get (at maximum) in quarters when face to Brazil.
Nigeria will be eliminated from the group stage cause they got a very weak defence line

المغرب كان ضعيف في مباراه أمام جنوب افريقيا
"Señores esto fútbol africano, nunca des nada por hecho 😅😅😅"
"I do not want to see the key players were absent , and the coach was trying new tactics and played many players out of their regular position , the main cause is fatigue , playing in south africa , end of season fatigue ,Combined with a previous match versus cap vert just two days before this match take into account the long travel and training session, the game was just like a training session for the players and the coach tested new faces , but they failed , morocco is going to win the CAN Africa Inchallah , the only rival team is Senegal we scored an own goal , Bono did not play , amrabat, ounahi, boufal , khannouss, abde, Harit , Adli the star in germany , etc"
&#39;&#39; from Algeria congratulations to sa &#39;&#39; 😂 😂 <br>imagine being so butthurt by Morocco that everyone who is up against Morocco is your boyfriend for the night 😂 😂

Le Maroc reste une grande équipe et ce n&#39;est que le début..Argentine à été battue par Arabie Saoudite et cette même Argentine gagna la coupe du monde..à vous de méditer..haha

Both Goals were goalkeeper&#39;s fault
تعليقات العرب مخزية.. كل واحد من العرب (المسلمين) دول يتق الله، كلنا إخوة في الإسلام، اقسم بالله في حياتي ما شفت أتفه من المشاحنة غير الضرورية والحمقاء اللي بين المغرب والجزائر، يعني الحكومات المفروض شيئ والشعوب شيئ، لكن بنشوف العكس في كل حتة بين الإتنين دول وعلي حاجات تافهة، دي كورة يا ناس إفهموا واتقوا الله وكفاية فتنة متكونوش أطفال
"TAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU THE KINGGGGGGGGGGGG FROM BAFANA BAFANA, BIG LOVE TO YOU GUYS!!!! 🇿🇦🇪🇬"
"morocco already qualified and trying to put the C players for the first time in the team, it&#39;s normal to loose such kind of matches. <br><br>for example against cap vert, the middle was replaced 2/3, and in this match 3/3, totaly an other team with new goalkeeper and attack.<br>congratulation to south africa, but this is no the team who faced brazil spain or portugal. you may desagree but it&#39;s the reality"
"a win is a win congrats to south Africa from morocco , it&#39;s like when morocco win against brazil not all players were present but a win is a win"

Quality could be better. But thank you nonetheless.
The logic has been respected
Football History lessons : South African players won the Uefa championship before Bono won the Europa... SA players captained EPL teams before any Moroccan player can player in the EPL.... Our league is the best in Afrika in every aspect....if you play in the PSL  it&#39;s the same as playing in Belgium... Holland...so going abroad is not high up in our list... Siyawuthanda unobhutshuzwayo The only soccer stadium that is bigger than our Calabash is Spotify nou camp in the whole world and the Old Maracana... We have a derby that host a bigger capacity than anything that Wimbledon has ever seen.....Our soccer fraternity is built to celebrate the greatness of anyone who represents the continent at his best... In the 90&#39;s the! Nigerian team of Sunday Oliseh we knew the whole line up of the Eagles.... Early 2000 we were taken by Cameroon of Mboma and eto.. Two. Most popular Egyptian footballers in South Africa are hosam Hassan and the greatest North African player Mohammed Aboutrika...during the Caf games we always want Raja and Waydad to be present they are doing something great for the continental soccer.... Add and correct.... See you in In Ivory Coast
"Morroco has a great coach your achievements at past world cup bring us(Caf) closer to the final,  to the rest of the continent the race is who gets to the final.... Then next finishing line is who will be the first one to win the world cup."
From Algeria 🇩🇿 Congratulations to 🇿🇦
Great game see you in Ivory coast 🐃🐃🐃🐎🐎🐎🐎

الف الف مبروك لخوتنا جنوب افريقيا الانتصار على الجارة غير الشقيقة بنغلادش عن جدارة واستحقاق
Bafana Bafana is finally looking good enough to play for the country!!
من قلب مصري باذن اللة المنتخب الوطني المغربي هيعوض
"Ok just a friendly match , but morocco must work hard to comfirm his positon"
"نصر عادي و مستحق لمنتخب جنوب إفريقيا , لا أدري لماذا الجميع يعلقون و كأن جنوب إفريقيا هي منتخب غينيا الإستوائية أو التوغو !! منتخب جنوب إفريقيا منتخب قوي و من كبار القارة , لا تنسوا أنه أقصى منتخب مصر من كأس إفريقيا التي لعبت على أرض مصر و فاز بها منتخب الجزائر , أظن أن منتخب جنوب إفريقيا سيحقق شيئا ما في البطولة القادمة في كوت ديفوار و لكن عليه الحذر من منتخبات السنغال الجزائر و مالي فهم أيضا مرشحون للتتويج إن شاء الله."
Hakim Ziech is the best player in Africa
Morocco welcom to Africa 😂
انتصار مستحق لجنوب افريقيا المنتخب المغربي سيعاني في افريقيا اظن حتى الحظ خدمه في كاس العالم واللعبين دخلهم الغرور

C&#39;est honteux de ne pas avoir un deuxième gardien pour une équipe national comme le maroc ou tous les moyens sont disponible😂
Le gardien marocain est NULLE
"Watching this game made me miss Bono, Ounahi, Amrabat, El Khannous, Amallah, Boufal, EZ Abde etc but this game was more or less friendly game so it was good time for Regragui to test out some new tactics and give some playing time to some how dosent have much in the past…<br>Congrats to SA from Morocco 🇲🇦🫱🏽‍🫲🏾🇿🇦"
"I don&#39;t know, South Africas goals don&#39;t make me that happy. We still don&#39;t know how to score properly, most of the time we are passing thr keeper. Don&#39;t thr players see the angles? Come on, we can do better."
We played the second team but fair play

Morocco need to find a better goalkeeper.
South Africa played really well.
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/iKFQaucr8JU"">https://youtu.be/iKFQaucr8JU</a>"
Algerians are the morons of Africa hands down. They are happy more than south africans because we lost a meaningless game where our coach tried new players and tactics. We reached the semifinal of the world cup and we are number 11 in FIFA ranking and we are going to beat all the teams in the two coming AFCON and win at least one of them before making again history in 2026. Meanwhile south Africa hasn&#39;t yet qualified to a world cup though it played once as host and got humiliated
هدف عالمي من زياش 🇪🇬
Good job 👌👌👌

ي اخي بيقولو ليه  الوطن العربي مش متوحد و السبب كمية الحقد بالتعاليق و التهنئة  علشان فازو على اخوانهم المسلمين...الله يشوف من حالنا يارب
تاو تاو تاو 🔥🦅💪
Morocco is already qualified and the coach is smart to try new young players in the match to see how qualified they are....not necessary to win the match but Morocco prepare for the next Africa cup.
Goalkeeper fault
The Moroccan team has been humiliated Sundowns team Congratulations South Africa 🇩🇿👌

Very sad 😢
⛈️
Wait for 2026 CR7 will be there
Santos should have started with ronaldo how on earth you make a genuine goal scorer to sit on bench
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COHjJEENyPQ&amp;t=7m08s"">7:08</a> what if ronaldo did the bicycle goal what happened then"
The substitution that scared no one
"Cristiano dice q no cambiaría sus 5 Champions por un Mundial y cuando lo eliminaron de las Champion no lloró, eso lo dice Todo."
"Portugal deserved this loss, so many good chances and they wasted every single one"
"I remember pepe and bruno cried something about refs,even tho there was no ANY wrong ref calls ahainst portugal haha"
Ronaldo crying or smiling 😅
Maldito del tecnico... aun no entiendo como pudo dejar a Cristiano Ronaldo en la banca 😢
1 year since it happened 💔
Ronaldo was half time play
Morocco is not switzerland
Coba dari awal Ronaldo di masukan

Morrocco robbed portugal
"Tristemente no pude ver este partido en vivo, estaba trabajando, y aun no me lo perdono. Tal vez nunca veas este mensaje, pero tu fuiste la razon de mi amor por el futbol desde que tengo consciencia. Esas ganas de devorarte el mundo que siempre cargas, ese coraje, esa conviccion de ti mismo y esa seguridad, encima que sabes que siempre puedes dar mas de ti, ESO ES LO QUE TE HACE EL MEJOR. Te amo Cristiano, y gracias por tanto. 🐐🇵🇹 EL BICHO 🇵🇹🐐"
❤🇲🇦🇵🇹
❤❤❤
Thnx to Morocco for saving the world from pollution 😂😂
I was so happy that Portugal didn&#39;t win😂😂....i just love this highlight i always watch this whenever i want to be happy...😂😂😂😂
The game that made Penaldo fans cried forever.
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤😂🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦😁😁😁😁
People thinking that Ronaldo can step a foot in the US for the next WC 😂
💉💉💉
Técnico sacou o Cristiano do jogo e deu merda.<br>Sem novidades.
Penaldo no penalty no party
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Croatia ,Balgium. canada. And spain you forgot😂and portugal😊"
Morocco has the best goalkeeper in the world and has the best left back in the world
Everyone hates Ronaldo because he is best❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
I was literally in a mood to break my tv(broke the remote) after my childhood inspiration and the goat cr7 lose the match.. I cried hard and that was the day when I cried the most.. 😢😢😢
To blame the keeper for coming out is fair it&#39;s clearly a mistake but to say that that shot is a clear and easy save is pure delusion look at the speed of the header without slow motion and also the placement right below the bar that&#39;s still a very hard save to be made even if the keeper was perfectly positioned
"Podría ser un excelente video si no fuera por los cambios de cámara innecesarios que haces continuamente, como en <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COHjJEENyPQ&amp;t=2m46s"">2:46</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COHjJEENyPQ&amp;t=3m15s"">3:15</a> y <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COHjJEENyPQ&amp;t=3m27s"">3:27</a>, lo único que se gana con esa tontería es perder el hilo de la jugada."
and that’s how Ronaldo maintains his 100% win rate in World Cup finals
moroccos defond ma chaa alah
One day india will Qualify for the world cup 🫀🇮🇳❤️‍🩹
Why is this in my feed after 4 months while Portugal just won 10/10 euro qualifier games? 😂

I just hate the coach for keeping ronaldo in bench the worst mistake ever 😭😭
Joa felix por Rafael leáo j. Cancelo x dalot jaja un chiste todo fue un chiste
I hate Ronaldo because of the fans And i hate Ronaldo fans because of Ronaldo same attitude
"Expulsaron un marroquí ,  pepe se perdio una que mi abuelita la mete, cr7 clavado en el area y no hizo nada y aun asi dicen que era para favorecer a Argentina?   Haganse serios."
Kok Ronaldo JD cadangan

Skakmat is arogan 😂😂
"En el primer tiempo hubo solo 1 equipo decidido a ganar y fué Marruecos mientras que Portugal lleno de temores regaló el primer tiempo.<br> En el segundo tiempo Portugal se vió obligado a ser protagonista y tuvo suficientes oportunidades para anotar pero fallaron sus goles y la entrada de CR7 fué el ultimo error del entrenador, ya que el equipo necesitaba otro mediocampista para manejar el partido desde la tenencia y la entrada de Ronaldo arruinó todas las ilusiones para ganar, ya que estaba lento, viejo e incapaz de ayudar a armar una miserable jugada. Merecida victoria de Marruecos y justa derrota de Portugal."
Believe me 2026 portugal win the. Cup
👇I am cr7 number one fan how about you
Ronaldo&#39;s the goat
Ronaldo&#39;s team  like
Cr7🗿🛐GOAT&gt;&gt;&gt;
Thé Portugais coach needs to be fired! He Send Ronaldo at the bench and he could’ve score many many goals then Morocco!😡😡😡
Ronaldo crying 😢  So Sa....<br>So Goood 😂
"I am totally Leo&#39;s fan, but I cried when Ronaldo was leaving the pitch..."
"I love the Scottish commentator. &quot;How d&#39;s he miss it? He&#39; been brilliant, but how does Pepe miss it?&quot; He really wants to know"
"cr7 is sitting on the bench, so that&#39;s why it happen early🙄"
Morocco 🇲🇦 🤝 Qatar 🇶🇦
"Shamefully exiting with tears... as long as you envy Messi, you can never climb up to his heights."
Ronaldo said that he gonna play one more world cup!
As a messi fan this match was absolutely the best 😂
very good match
Messi rewatching this on his couch with his WC trophy on his hand.
Felix and bruno got pretty good chances tbh😷
Big mistake by the keeper and you cannot let CR7 on the bench on a WC QF match.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COHjJEENyPQ&amp;t=8m11s"">8:11</a> the GOAT know it 😢"

So what you don&#39;t have any world cup. But you have the world 🌏🤴. Your unbelievable career is valuable more than world cup. No one can judge you for don&#39;t having a world cup. You are the only GOAT forever🤴
Don’t ever play against the lions 🦁 they are very dangerous

"It was an indescribable joy for me as a Moroccan when Morocco won those matches against teams that were difficult to overcome. This was an achievement for Morocco to reach the semi-finals, but football remains a game. Sometimes you lose and sometimes you win❤."

Melhor dia da minha vida.<br>The best day of my life!!!
I really don’t understand how the Porto keeper became the starting keeper for Portugal in Qatar 22. Rui should’ve continued to be the starting keeper.
Ronaldo said 🥺 match
If ronaldo was playing in thi first place they woold have won
F###### maracco
Fuck up porchugal coach😢
"i wish portugal get a star on 2k26 worldcup<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>❤"
ronaldos reactions to this game were rather arragant i get it ur upset your not playing but that doesnt mean you would have fixed the sitaution .once it was 1-0 portugal shoudl have put ronaldo in
Pessi
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COHjJEENyPQ&amp;t=4m44s"">4:44</a> what does he mean “don’t you worry about it he means it”"
"Si cristiano llegará a ganar el mundial de 2026, el debate jamás terminaría, están de acuerdo?"
Should’ve started Ronaldo to be honest. He always gives his all. Especially being his last World Cup. Hope he comes back.
Penaldo 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FAILURE 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tbh I only feel sad for ronaldo in Portugal  bcz all other players are just self fish
😭😭😭😭
