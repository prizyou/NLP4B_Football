"Eras of the World cup<br><br>The beginnings (1930 - 1954)<br>World cup is getting defined and becoming an important event. This era is marked by a dominance of Uruguay and Italy, as well as an unlikely German triumph. Brazil hadn&#39;t become a powerhouse (losing the only final they played up to this point) and Hungary was very powerful, but failed to win any trophies. <br><br>Pele&#39;s era (1958 - 1970)<br>Brazil win 3 out of 4 World cups. The only exception is England&#39;s sole triumph on home soil against Germany. Pele becomes the only player with 3 World cup medals. <br><br>The rise of total football (1974 - 1978)<br>Introduced in Netherlands, total football revolution helped Netherlands to two consecutive World cup finals, which they lost to the host teams both times. Argentina win their first ever World cup. <br><br>The dominance of Germany (1982 - 1990)<br>Largely overlapping with Maradona&#39;s World cup career, this era was marked by none less than 3 consecutive World cup finals for Germany, the first time ever for any country. They lost two in a row before finally winning one, taking revenge on Argentina the very next World cup. <br><br>The dominance of Brazil (1994 - 2002)<br>One string of 3 consecutive World cup finals was immediately followed by another one. Brazil joined Germany in demonstrating why they&#39;re the best footballing nations of their respective continents. Brazil won two World cups, with a loss to France in between, giving France their first ever World cup title. <br><br>European dominance (2006 - 2018)<br>Europe wins 4 World cups in a row, a record for a continent. Italy, Spain, Germany and France get their triumphs in four of these finals, with all except one of them being all-european finals (Argentina played the 2014 final). Croatia stand out with the best underdog story in modern World cup history. <br><br>2022- Dominance of Argentina/South America???",youtube,,international

Still I cannot see offside in the first Real Madrid goal. The Spanish Federation should draw the lines on the whole frame. Disallowing the second goal is also ludicrous.

"I think I figured out the solution to our bad form, Xhaka needs to come back to CDM with Partey like he played last season, then we play Saka and Martinelli in their respective wings inclusive of the wing and midfield, sub off Odegaard and then play Trossard and Nketiah up front, with Trossard as the Left Striker and Nketiah on the right, this combo will have Nketiah quick feet for the through balls and Trossard&#39;s immaculate finishing, long range, upclose, 1v 1, and still have Martinelli and Saka do what they do best.",youtube,,league

Eddie nketiah is very good in games when opposition doesn&#39;t put all their players to defend and make spaces tight. Man City is one such game. In contrast both Everton and Brentford came up with a defensive formation. So Eddie will definitely cause problems for City,youtube,,league
Arteta must drop Nketia he has taken it for granted that he is the best striker they have. Trossard has more grit and drive. Martineli needs to bring on the magic  defenders know he will try to out run them and it&#39;s not working. If you lose to City it&#39;s over so you need to play without Nketia and 4x3x3 so midfield is shut. Come on Gunners it&#39;s your year.,youtube,,league

"now its Maddison,Richarlison,Heung Min Son and Johnson.<br>This combination is 🔥",youtube,,league
"Give Son Heung-min, who is rushing in front of the goal, as many passes as possible due to cutbacks. As long as the ball is delivered to him, he will 100% lead to a goal. He does not enjoy fighting and heading like other strikers, and his main weapons are a fast sprinter and excellent finishing with both feet. He&#39;s a striker~",youtube,,league
Look at that clever move by Johnson~ Richarlison has to give up his seat to Johnson.,youtube,,league

Son and Madi what else?,youtube,,league
"Korean soccer player Son Heung-min has the following advantages:
<br>1. Fast speed and dribbling ability: Son Heung-min is considered one of the fastest players in Europe. Using this speed to beat opposing defenders and shoot, it has become Son Heung-min&#39;s signature move.
<br>2. Accurate shooting power: Son Heung-min is a player who freely uses both feet, and has accurate shooting power with both his left and right feet. This shooting ability is what enabled him to score 23 goals in the Premier League.
<br>3. Strong mentality: Son Heung-min has a strong mentality that does not give up even when facing difficulties on the European stage. He made his presence known through consistent performance despite his injuries and the team&#39;s poor performance.",youtube,,league
