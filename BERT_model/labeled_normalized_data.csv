656,Italy and England is like 1 sided rivalry for England Italy is an extremley tough opponent a football giant with 6 trophies that they just can never seem to defeat except in non important games like Friendlies and for Italy they see England as a small team with only 1 trophy from 1966 and whenever they face in a major tournament it's an automatic victory for Italy despite England being capable of bringing Italy to a penalty shootout like if they face in a group stage it's an automatic 3 points for Italy if they face in a Quarter-final it's an automatic qualification to the next round for Italy and if they face in a final then Italy automatically wins the trophy,youtube,0

682,This Never GEts Old though JOrginho should have been replaced who would cost them making World Cup missing PK too.  Putting guys in the 120th minute who don't belong on the pitch really worked out.  Italy had that happen where guy they subbed in at like 120th missed the PK leading to a loss too :).  Reminds me of 2012 when England gets crossbar after Buffon dove the wrong way. That is still better than getting the post on the ground when guy is laying on ground :).  Man when I played we wouldn't even be on team if took PKs like most these guys.  All this BS instead of just picking a corner with velocity or side. Even right at the goalie scores more than trying to be cute.  When up 2 1 gotta just get it on net at very least ;).  Glad Italy Finally Won :).,youtube,0

1053,Spurs fan. Adore Harry Kane :red_heart:,youtube,0
1054,Was Kane the only one who scored? No? You’d think so by every Bayern game thumbnail,youtube,0
1055,They have to utilise kane more at champions league level. Sane and coman may be able to run around galatasary and those other mooks at bundesliga level. But up against quality defenders who know how to deal with pace theyl do nothing. Hes there to score and provide so do it bayern wont win at this level hogging the ball and trying to be clever all the time.,youtube,0
1056,Musiala :clapping_hands::clapping_hands:,youtube,0
1057,Can a Bayern fan please tell me what is Coman and Sane's beef with kane all about? Seem pretty chill to pass it amongst themselves but when its Kane all of a sudden hes invisible to them. Can't help but think Kane would so much rather be at spurs rn than this Bayern team as good as they are no disrespect.,youtube,0
1058,Kane would be getting 4 goals a game if his team bloody passed to him. Imagine being top scorer feeding off scraps,youtube,1

1063,Galatassary fans are always saying they are the best club in the world when they aren't good thing there team got humbled,youtube,0
1064,Galatasaray played suicidal and defending was on the shoulders of four players so Bayer easily exploited the numerical advantage in attack.,youtube,0
1065,first 55 minutes it looked very promising for Galatasaray but after subs it just started to crash. If Kerem Akturkoglu had a better finishing he would have been playing for any PL team. It was very entertaining game to watchGs li degilim,youtube,0

1068,The title says Clinical Kane but then the commentator says that he's been misfiring all night :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:,youtube,0
1069,If Sane some minor aspects to his game like finding the right pass and keeping in his negative attitude then he would be a great player,youtube,0
1070,If kane continues in this current form Ballon D'Or,youtube,0
1071,bro who is this commemtator hes so boring it sends me to sleep xD. he should be a golf commentator,youtube,0
1072,Might as well stop running if Sane has the ball. He won’t pass.,youtube,0
1073,If any of u actually watched the match galatasaray did very well amazing pressure but ultimately got tired. First half we dominated all the way up to 70th min then 75th min we conceded everyone was tired bayern defending then towards the end they walked through us..,youtube,0
1074,sane is some player,youtube,0
1075,Bayern might have the world's best attack rn but they need to fix that goalkeeper,youtube,0
1076,First half Bayern couldn't touch the ball. Galatasaray played amazing until the 75th minute. Then they got tired and Bayern got the lead. Quality of the players but most importantly their conditions gave them a free win. In my opinion Gala deserved to win - at least draw - but this is champions league. Congrats to Bayern.,youtube,0
1077,Those pricks ain’t team players and the manager needs to put a rocket up their arses.We know who they are they need to start passing to their striker and this team would score a lot more goals.This team won’t win this trophy as ego is more important than team.,youtube,1

1079,Thought Galatasary by them highlights deserved a point should have scored more but didnt take them!,youtube,0
1080,Something about Kane reminds me of Bobby Charlton. Even if he's not quite on the same technical level (who is) Kane shares the deep sense of humility the workmanlike approach and the fearsome clinical finish.,youtube,0

1085,What was this recorded on an iPhone???,youtube,0
1086,Bayern players need to realize that Kane would have scored from that angle for the musiala goal but instead he passed the ball because he isn't selfish and also knows  what to be done at the right time,youtube,0
1087,Would love to see galatasray go far in the tournament they have a good team,youtube,0

1093,Gala destoryed bayern until 72nd minute Shouldve made changes around 65 min as some defenders were lacking a bit along midfield Was a great fun game to whatch,youtube,0

1108,Kane is the best striker in the WORLD. SIMPLE,youtube,0
1109,This Akturkoglu guy can’t shoot.. he gets into incredible positions but he misses far too much .. he should have scored at least twice … they need to send him to a finishing school,youtube,0
1110,Kane played for Tottenham.<br>Tottenham is a Jewish club.<br>Kane now plays for Bayern.<br>Bayern is a German club.<br>Jews do not like Germany.<br>Jews gave Bayern Kane...with their best wishes...:face_with_tears_of_joy:,youtube,0

1132,Harry Kane is a excellent player. Surprisingly he hasn't won a trophy/medal. With him being at Bayern Munich he has got to get a trophy/medal this season,youtube,0
1133,I think Kane is so good he would score even at Chelsea.,youtube,0
1134,Galatasaray should have gone 3-1 upfront 1st half. They missed about 7 decent chances. Bayern was boxed in their half full 45 minutes with only a counter attack. <br>Bayern started showing their class only after 60-65 minute as Gala got tired. <br>I think Gala will lose the return leg in Germany too next. But will qualify  as they are the second best team in the group.,youtube,0
1135,What a pen from icardi :red_heart::goat::goat:,youtube,0
1136,Kane is such an effective playmaker for a striker it's incredible. Nothing he does is particularly flashy but he's super efficient. The way he comes deep for the ball and plays it through or heads it onto his wingers is something he does better than anyone else. Bayern really need to find a way to give him service without him having to move out of position though if they want to win anything.,youtube,0
1137,I hate harry kane,youtube,1

1332,Great stuff from Bellingham but he’s just started. Let’s not get carried away I see people in the comments comparing him to Pele :face_with_tears_of_joy:. Relax guys. He has to do it season in season out for a long period of time. Right now let’s just enjoy his football and not state outlandish stuff.,youtube,0
1333,I always thought Bellingham was overhyped and Madrid made the wrong choice in buying him but boy was I wrong dude is smart and gifted! What a performance and player! Wait till they buy Mbappe :O,youtube,0

1348,Bellingham's last assist unreal!,youtube,0
1349,Jude is getting at least 30 goals this season with the way he’s been playing! Hopefully he keeps fit. Best player in the world rn plays effortlessly.,youtube,0
1350,Title should be jude helps inspire but cause he's English jude inspires  even though rodrygo got first goal,youtube,0
1351,What a ball for the fourth goal surprised the commentators didn’t make a bigger noise.,youtube,0

1358,Everyone is talking about Bellingham and I know he is insane right now but I feel we need to give Rodrygo some respect. He is playing brilliantly filling in for vini and I think he could go on to score a ton more goals by the end of the season:clapping_hands::clapping_hands::clapping_hands:,youtube,0
1359,Rodrygo is a monster.,youtube,0
1360,Should have shown Bellingham in midfield before the last goal. Not only did he get the assist but he started the whole move!,youtube,0
1361,When bellingham scored it made the score 1-1 it was meant to be 2-0,youtube,0
1362,I wish Bellingham played for Newcastle :disappointed_face:,youtube,0
1363,Bellingham ... english machine !,youtube,0
1364,If RM had better forwards Belllingham would have had four assists in this match. What really stood out for me was Bellingham's run for his goal. He was unmarked because of his vision to run into the space for the cross. This is his 'footballing intelligence' which is the key to his goalscoring success.,youtube,0
1365,If Jude keeps going at this rate and Real win the champions league the Ballon d’or will have his name on it :saluting_face:,youtube,0

1394,Has everyone forgotten Inter was starting 8 of their subs in this game? Immediate impact from Thuram in the second half. And even Lautaro has just played the final 10 minutes of the game.

1449,Commentary : “ he scored against is own club “I mean Joao Mario was sold it’s not his club. And they kept saying the same :face_with_tears_of_joy:That red card and penalty were a disgrace. Completely wrong. Also seen people commenting that everyone is against Benfica in this season well I don’t think so unfortunately for Benfica was unfair that penalty completely wrong but the rest of the CL games it’s on them they just couldn’t play good.

1466,Istanbul 2005 Bollywood edition,youtube,0
1467,There were 2 clear referee mistakes.The penalty is not a penalty as the Benfica defender quicks the ball and is Inter striker that goes against the legs of the Benfica defender as he could not stop running. The direct sent off of the Benfica defender is too severe as a yellow card should be the right decision.There was no aggression from the Benfica defender as he just wanted to play the ball.Very bad referring and when is on a champions league game it is total unacceptable. Benfica was robbed of a clear victory. :face_with_open_mouth:,youtube,0

1617,Haven’t seen an Arsenal keeper make a save like Ramsdale’s since… Ramsdale. Raya never ever saves anything he shouldn’t the goal at Villa was right at him just needed to stand tall but Allison won Liverpool 2 points at Palace put them top and that’s why we will lose the competitions we’re in this season because Arteta won’t see he’s wrong until it’s too late,youtube,0

1621,Okay it doesn’t really matter whether they win or lose they have overwhelmingly qualified for the next round. I suppose they have to go through the process that might influence who could possibly qualify with them. Not that it matters for Arsenal fans.,youtube,0

1639,I think the selection and the subs used in this game were needless from Arteta. I’ve no idea why he’s against playing the youngsters in a game like this. I genuinely believe that if Saka was in the U-21’s when Arteta joined us he’d be nowhere near as established as he is now,youtube,0

They get abuse like sterling is all the time. Look at balotelli. They are not appreciated in Europe.,youtube,0

1852,I do not want to see the key players were absent  and the coach was trying new tactics and played many players out of their regular position  the main cause is fatigue  playing in south africa  end of season fatigue Combined with a previous match versus cap vert just two days before this match take into account the long travel and training session the game was just like a training session for the players and the coach tested new faces  but they failed  morocco is going to win the CAN Africa Inchallah  the only rival team is Senegal we scored an own goal  Bono did not play  amrabat ounahi boufal  khannouss abde Harit  Adli the star in germany  etc,youtube,0

We have a derby that host a bigger capacity than anything that Wimbledon has ever seen.....Our soccer fraternity is built to celebrate the greatness of anyone who represents the continent at his best... In the 90's the! Nigerian team of Sunday Oliseh we knew the whole line up of the Eagles.... Early 2000 we were taken by Cameroon of Mboma and eto.. Two. Most popular Egyptian footballers in South Africa are hosam Hassan and the greatest North African player Mohammed Aboutrika...during the Caf games we always want Raja and Waydad to be present they are doing something great for the continental soccer....

We have good players, not as good as one generation before, especially in the Defense which is horrific right now tbh, but midfield and attack has great potential, at least in theory.

2330,"1. A lot of people had problems with his attitude when he was playing. He always seemed like he was lacking motivation. 2. Made the famous pic with Erdogan. While Gundogan apologized for taking it, Ozil called everyone who criticized him for it a racist and islamophobic. 3. Had Erdogan as his best man at his wedding4. As a tattoo with a symbol of the grey wolves. They’re a nationalistic, racist and far right organization. Ozil as a player was class, as a human being he’s not so great I guess",reddit,1
2331," Read the newest Interview with his father, he is talking what the big problem with his career was.

2336,1. Accused of being lazy 2. Made a post calling out China for their treatment of the local Muslim population. Arsenal didn’t have his back and the fans called him “political” 3. Open “support” of Erdogan. 4. Accused the DFB of Islamophobia 5. Refused to cut his wages during the pandemic I like Ozil and think that some of these accusations lack context and are circunstancial at best. Football Iconic made a really great video about Ozil that I highly recommendhttps://youtu.be/8dIQ56YACvE?si=fgADRHdiCkqG387P,reddit,0
2337, Supported a dictator. Called him “My President”.He wasn’t really a revolutionary player. A classic playmaker that lacked consistency to be considered one of the true greats.,reddit,0
2338, He's the antisemitic bream.,reddit,1
2339,"He acted like a man child at Arsenal aswell. Managed to turn the narrative on his side that the only issue Arsenal had with him is the Uighur stuff. That was a shit move from our club but he had massive issues here prior. He was a big reason Emery got sacked because Emery hated his attitude and began benching him, but Ozil turned the squad against him instead.Freddie also openly criticised him and Arteta also became fed up with his attitude in the end and finally cast him out. He sat on a monstrous contract he wasn’t justifying and was a big part of our shit locker room mentality but he always had god tier PR that made him look the victim no matter what.",reddit,1

2346,People don’t like him because of his political opinions as they act like they’re experts in Turkish politics. As a player I can agree people would consider his mentality weak or unprofessional,reddit,0
2347,"Political matters. Had a picture with the Turkish president 2 months before the 2018 World Cup , where Germany as a whole messed up the entire tournament , and got blamed for the disaster. Then expressed his support to Uyghur Turks which leaves Chinese under blame , who had a huge chunk of stocks at Arsenal, which ruined it entirely for him",reddit,0
2348, Openly supporting any right-wing politician = cancelled. That’s all you need to know.,reddit,0
2349, He was honest about his political beliefs unlike almost every other footballer and got hatred for not apologising like Gundo did. He also had a ‘lazy’ play style that is a lightning rod for criticism unless you’re winning every game.,reddit,0
2350,"Had a close relationship with Turkish president (dictator) Erdogan, supported a far right Turkish terrorist group, acted like a Turkish nationalist but refused to join Turkish National team and he lied about it saying he wasnt invited to the Turkish National team, also accused his german teammates of racism, when he arrived at Turkey he was really underwhelming at Fenerbahce then ended his career at Istanbul Basaksehir (A team that is owned by president Erdogan and his far right buddies)",reddit,0

2352, Never moved faster than a light jog and couldn't tackle,reddit,0
2353,The moment he showed his Muslim identity he became public enemy for the bigots and Islamophobes. Including Arsenal reprimanding him for speaking out against the plight of the Uighurs at the hands of the Chinese government.,reddit,0

2355," In terms of being underrated on the pitch, just his casual and undemonstrative body language. Everything was so elegant he made it look simple and easy, whereas someone like Connor Gallagher steams around crashing into people and cant pass it ten yards but is lauded as a team player.In terms of hatred almost certainly rooted in Racism and Islamaphobia. He famoulsy said when i win Im German when i lose im Turkish. He called out the inhumane treatment or Uighur Mulsims in China when Arsenal did a promotional tour there which was the end of that relationship.He is a great footballer and human, among the most philanthropic out there.",reddit,0

2357,I mean Germany does have a history of racism and discrimination.,reddit,1
2358,"he didnt had the mental capacity to overcome racist slurs he was facing. dunno why he didnt turn to some professional support etc. to overcome it and then had some faux pas like the erdogan pic for what he got critics but combined with the racial/german turkophobia it was a grossly exaggerated reaction from german medias/germany overall. now they had a reason to be dismissive and hateful. it was justified now and didnt need any implications or between the lines to slur him. and imo he lost the overview and instead on focusing what he had he tried to compensate it with turkeypholia aka ""now more than ever"" because his homeland kinda didnt feel home-ish. latest downfall is his grey wolf tattoo. they are a turkish right-wing extremist movement. he is a grown man and is responsible for it by himself. but imo it is pretty sure that the systematic german turkophoby gave him the kick in that direction. ""OG germans dont like it when (turkish) migrants sit at the same table with them. they are used migrants/deutschtürken stay on the floor"" is what a migration researcher once said. now obviously there is (more) change but during özil s rise it was more than ever present. it was that generation that didnt depend/want depend/needed to depend on low income jobs like their parents/grandparents. gündogan is an example that overcame that system. i am more than sure he had to suck up a lot of german bullshit in order to stay where he is now. özil on the other hand is now just a shallow shell of turkish propaganda. That's there so low profile germany football ""analysts"" can dismisse his past influence and success.to say how exagerated german media was on özil. neuer once sang a croatian nazi song during his croatia holiday. 0 consequences or public apologies. gundogan didnt only apologize he had to openly prove ""his loyalty to germany"". özil didnt want to bow too low and tried to explain it.",reddit,1
2359,"People are soft and dont really understand people nor politics, easily triggered, misinformed etc.. also not to mention the whole turks in germany situation, incompatible cultures and all that. It really doesnt matter, Ozil is one of the most attractive mids that ever played, i enjoyed every minute of his field time. Long live Ozil!",reddit,0
2360, He spoke facts.,reddit,0
2361, He called out China for the uigher issue..China buys and sponsors alot of arsenals stuff.,reddit,0
2362," Being lazy on the pitch. And it’s not a myth either. There are numerous examples from highlights alone where you can pin at least a portion of the blame on Ozil for not bothering to track back or just dangling out a lazy leg. The Bayern thrashings were the perfect example of this. One or two goals where he lets Robben come inside, drift past him, then just jogs back at a snail’s pace.",reddit,0
2363, He reminds me of Berbatov.Amazing skills but seemingly no effort.Some of his assists were crazy good.,reddit,0
2364," Yeah he wasn't the most professional, plus he's been controversial on his political views. It's a shame, because talent-wise he's definitely one of my favorite players. I don't care much for Real Madrid but I got an Özil jersey just because I was fascinated with him.",reddit,0

Both were EXCELLENT players, don't get it twisted... Could say the same for Bale... Just coasting, picking up money and offering very little",reddit,0
2371, he preferred to act like a German during his early career and prime time and then decided to act like a Turkish when he got old/ his career started to decline. This is because he knew that he would benefit from being German in his very first years (German national team is far superior)and then he was acting like he rememberred who he actually was.,reddit,0
2372," I think you should look up the definition of revolutionary.He was good at his best, but he didn't change the way the game was played.",reddit,0
2373," A superb athlete loses all motivation upon achieving quite a lot to be fair. Mou read it early enough to boot him to Arsenal where he somewhat revitalized his ambition but petered out quickly. Also, his nonchalant body language was viewed by fans as a sign of not caring enough for the game and the team. Similarly, Berbatov and Arshavin were hated for their ""laziness"". But there is a room for players with this approach to the game and it is exactly why they find time and space to find that killer pass or a flick of a ball to leave the opponents frozen. On top of that you have your political and societal bullshit that only takes away from athletes than anything else.",reddit,1

2383,He has some views that the Western world dont agree with and people have since used those to justify hate and amplify his other apparent flaws. Its certainly overblown and a lot of other players are free from criticism for similar views/actions with their nation & heritage. Being nationalistic and right wing isnt something unique to Ozil - many footballers are but none get the hate like Ozil.Shitting on Muslims is trendy and closet Islamaphobia probably play a part too.,reddit,1

Continued by supporting a dictator who at the time (and still) was very, very anti-Germany, calling us Nazis for not allowing him to do his election campaign in Germany. Did not apologize for basically calling a foreign president ""his president"", a man who hates Germans. Instead, Ozil said that everyone was racist and islamophobic. Then, he got the tattoo of a fascist organization (which is against Jews and also Christianity, something not really popular here anymore).Lastly, he still only holds the German passport while living in Turkey, acting Turkish.
