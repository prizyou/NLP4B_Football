"The fact that there is not a singlegerman defender in Bayern’s starting lineup speaks volumes. Gone are the days of Boa , Lahm and Hummels , Ginter etc keeping it safe and quiet at the back. Bayern need to speed up and intensify development of some home grown defending talents if they don’t want to continue outsourcing expensive transfers from outside the league.As for Dortmund idk wth is up with Sule and Schlotterbeck just standing like two giant easter island dummies . If Rudiger could just put in some serious work in his performances like he does in his aggressive animated theatrics it will do him very well in the long run.",reddit,
"can turkish fans just shut the fuck up for one goddamn match, nobody enjoys your whistling",reddit,
Who is this Serge Gnabry guy and what did he do with Sergio Gnabinho,reddit,
" Unless the Turkish players all get possessed by scarecrows and we end the game with a 9-3 win, any outcome of this is embarrassing. We’re letting Turkey put 3 past us in Berlin? Come on I know we’re shit but still",reddit,

"This German team is actually hopeless, not even a Klopp-Pep combo can save this generation",reddit,
Why are they whistling like it’s the world cup final?Chill out,reddit,
 I'm just gonna mute every game where any Turkish team plays and sing/chant myself. I can't stand this whistling BS.,reddit,

"We will need an entire bus of therapists for our German national team players, if Germany plays like this in the group and gets knocked out.",reddit,
"I was optimistic over and over again and I got disappointed over and over again. For now, I lost all hope that these guys can grow together as a team. They just don’t fit. Literally every player has been tested in all possible formations and tactics. We even tried „the best coaches“ we have. The puzzle just doesn’t solve. We have good players, not as good as one generation before, especially in the Defense which is horrific right now tbh, but midfield and attack has great potential, at least in theory. But it seems they can’t be formed as a working unit. Maybe we have to accept and wait until it gets better. Our gems Musiala and Wirtz still have over a decade left. Plenty of time to form a team around them.",reddit,
 Getting drowned out at a home game is really something ngl. Was similar in the Gala game at home a few weeks ago as well. Not German but it kinda pisses me off,reddit,
Being a bird near a Turkish football stadium must be a very confusing experience,reddit,
 Whistling is lame. Lord Kai please shut them up,reddit,
 Never seen a team celebrate so much in s friendly..,reddit,
 Well this is embarrassing,reddit,
 Man these tactics are questionable at best. I know it's a friendly but there has been no adjustment at all since going down 3-2,reddit,
Can someone tell that Turkish player he can ask for Wirtz jersey after the match and not strip him during it,reddit,
 Turkey literally winning every second ball. How is the german team so consistently shit since 2018?,reddit,

"What we saw here was a typical JN Bayern game ImoSet up the team extremely well and start well, but the moment the opponent team adjusts he’s out of his depth. Reason why we threw so many games.",reddit,
" Cant play with a 3/5 defense when you dont even have the players for it sane and kai dont know the position to play the defensive part whole game with discipline And henrichs is wasted as rcb .When pressed high the offense doesnt drop far enough back and there is a big space between def and offense which forces long high balls and we dont have players who can shield the ball or win a header fülle a little but not nearly enough.Gündogan kimmich pairing is bad because they are both weak defensive and get outbodied and outrun, if you play with 2 you need 1 who can win the ball back.Quite a few more things but these are the big and important things.",reddit,
HAVERTZ DEFENDING?WHICH UNIVERSE IS THIS,reddit,
 ![gif](giphy|texPPGdPu32q4),reddit,
 Wow what a goal that was a worldclass shot.We have to stand up again and do sth,reddit,
There are 3 players on the pitch who think of defending. What are you cooking nagelsmann,reddit,
"that shot almost looks like a Kane shot, wtf",reddit,
France is up 7-0 and Upa is still on the pitch btw,reddit,
ugh Trapp had that,reddit,
How is thst not a yellow for the turkish player?,reddit,
 I understand Nagelsmann is trying new things and want to give everyone a chance but instead he should probably settle for a team that works and this one obviously didn't. So close to the EM he basically should've already decided who is in the team and who is not.,reddit,
I liked Sané in the first 20min but otherwise he is rather bad sadly,reddit,
No Müller no party,reddit,
 Getting Galatasaray flashbacks with these Turkish supporters.,reddit,
My god Sané is up to something today,reddit,
" Nice moves there, Julian!",reddit,
 What a fuckin pass. Holy shit,reddit,
Just tuned in to the game and as expected are the Turkish fans whistling like crazy!Also almost no German fan to be seen lol,reddit,
I want Wirtz,reddit,
" I like that JN is actually encouraging the German side to drop back and play on the counter when needed, not just mindless high line defence like Flick's and Löw's tactics",reddit,

No ThoMats tax,reddit,
" we'll surely come back and win this 3-2, relax boys",reddit,
 This is not an enjoyable game,reddit,
" Jesus, the playing out of the back is terrible...",reddit,
I have a bad feeling that Upa and King will play the full 90 lmaoe: King is out!,reddit,
 France 11-0 that's insane,reddit,
 That was pretty nice by Henrichs.,reddit,
And so the cramps begin…,reddit,
 Getting Olé chants against you in your own stadium is kinda nuts man.. lmaooo. Germany are finished,reddit,
Ref whistling every time a Turkish player throws himself to the ground..,reddit,
 I know a lot of people who are going to be absolutely insufferable about this loss for the next few years,reddit,
 Banger tackle by Henrichs,reddit,
:D Turkey playing this game as if it is a world cup final.,reddit,
Oh wow,reddit,
ThoMats lmao,reddit,
The last 15min were boring,reddit,
Bro wanted a hug,reddit,
" The German team is so weirdly bad in midfield, just a total loss of control most of the time when you have players like Gündogan, Wirtz, Kimmich and Brandt who should hypothetically be in control",reddit,
 What I like about current Bayern is that we are really good in reacting to conceded goals. Both Germany team and previous Bayern (with Julian and early Tuchel) seems to collapsing right away.,reddit,
" It feels like our midfield is actively waiting not to pass to Sané when he can make a run, only when he’s literally next to a defender they decide to pass. It’s so infuriating to watch, like what the fuck are you waiting for?",reddit,
what on earth was that by Yildiz,reddit,
 Somehow I expected this,reddit,
" German commentary praising Groß again, but I don't understand why",reddit,
The amount of runs Sane makes that get wasted or played too late is mind blowing,reddit,
This is such an ugly game. Not even talking about the game/passes/strategies but the way the players on both teams behave.,reddit,
The insane number of handball pens is ruining the game,reddit,
Trapp even guessed the right way....,reddit,
 7 minutes?? just call it a day man lmao,reddit,
Yildiz was one of ours and could’ve been a german national fyi,reddit,

i hope we have wirtz already secured,reddit,
Back to winning the Euros baby,reddit,
"No clue if Wirtz has any clause in his contract, but at this point the guy should not cost a single cent less than Bellingham if Leverkusen isn't dumb",reddit,
 comms between Kimmich and Leroy kinda off right now,reddit,
France is up 9:0 and Coman is the only one who scored more than once lol,reddit,
"i think brandt would be such a baller if he was our player, but bvb pulls all players down",reddit,
 I'm fine with this penalty. He wasn't in sprint excusing the arms moving excessively and he looked at him before he crossed in.,reddit,
 Damn Gnabry,reddit,
How did he miss that,reddit,
" You start havertz, you get sacked. It’s been the way since the inception of havertz. No manager is immune to havertz. Nagelsmann if he’s smart, will realise the curse before he gets the pink slip",reddit,
Imagine telling someone a year ago that Havertz would be Germany’s best defender,reddit,
 Gundo is a criminal for not returning that pass on the wing. That was a full on counter waiting to happen,reddit,
 Sané looks completely checked out,reddit,
Interested to see how Havertz works out as L(W)B,reddit,
 Turks and their whistling..,reddit,
 SANÉ! Thought he scores/shots himself,reddit,
Whistle that lol,reddit,
I like Henrichs so far,reddit,
That pass by Kimmich wow,reddit,
Ahhhh shit. That was a good shot tbf,reddit,
"Damn, that was something and a half.",reddit,
 wtf,reddit,
I mean his hand is in a natural position idk,reddit,

" Deschamps, my man, what about subbing Upa and Coman",reddit,
 Where was right back?,reddit,
I honestly think we won't get Wirtz. He will be way too expensive.,reddit,
" This team is a joke, we will get embarassed in the euros at home.",reddit,
Wonder what playing against Turkey must feel like for Gündo right now.,reddit,
Best LB in the world !!!,reddit,
 just put 100 on the table for wirtz,reddit,
"Sane has to be a bit more selfish again, sometimes he could do it himself but he seems scared.Hes still a worldclass player rn",reddit,

Damn,reddit,
 Lückeee,reddit,
Come on Gündo. Just kicked it straight at the defender in front of him lol,reddit,
Uh oh... Smells like a harsh pen,reddit,
 Ffs,reddit,
 Tah should play as RB and Hummels next to Rüdiger,reddit,
 That's 100% a penalty,reddit,
 I dont know if Müller on the bench will ever feel right,reddit,
Kimmich has been so good,reddit,
 Ref that's not a pen...,reddit,
 \^gnabry how on earth do you not go with your left foot first,reddit,
what even was henrichs doing? is he not the RB,reddit,
" Gnabry has been Thunderstruck, we gotta find the white boy that got his power",reddit,
" Still think Germany has a better chance of winning the euros than England, for example.",reddit,
" Suggesting that 3 at the back is a good idea with this squad is a sackable offence. It just shows such an awful lack of tactical awareness, historic source digestion and creativity. It’s like suggesting we don’t play with a goalkeeper or putting Havertz in defence.",reddit,
I feel much more comfortable with Trapp in goal than Hair Stegen,reddit,
What position is havertz playing,reddit,
" Hansi Flick wasn't the problem, but he definitely had too much trust in Kimmich and should have done more to keep Kroos.My opinion keeping player like Hummels, Boateng, and Muller away from the team after 2018 really hurt the identity of the team. I actually think that the 35 Yr olds Hummels and Boateng would be a better pair than anything we have seen so far, obviously never going to happen. This group can still win the Euros but it will have to come from an entire overhall within german football. The question is can Nagelsmann be the one to orchestrate this change.",reddit,
 not ready to watch havertz play,reddit,
let Naggy cook,reddit,
tersetegen with the ball is a horrorshow,reddit,
How can we watch in the US? I cannot not find it,reddit,

"Credit where credit is due, that was nice!",reddit,
 That was bad by gündo,reddit,

 What do all these managers see in Havertz really? Like... why do so many want to die on this hill out of all hills? I really thought Nagelsmann would be pragmatic but he just can't help himself can he?,reddit,

No matter what happens - I am proud of how this team recovered from 2017. In saying that - we have a great chance of doing this. The 2 last euro cup finals we were against the world champions and were absolutely not favourites at all. I don’t think we’re favourites now - but it’s as close to 50/50 as it’ll be IMO,reddit,

" Im Turkish.

 He has a tatoo of a Turkish far-right organization.,reddit,
"1. A lot of people had problems with his attitude when he was playing. He always seemed like he was lacking motivation. 2. Made the famous pic with Erdogan. While Gundogan apologized for taking it, Ozil called everyone who criticized him for it a racist and islamophobic. 3. Had Erdogan as his best man at his wedding4. As a tattoo with a symbol of the grey wolves. They’re a nationalistic, racist and far right organization. Ozil as a player was class, as a human being he’s not so great I guess",reddit,
" Read the newest Interview with his father, he is talking what the big problem with his career was. Got every opportunity in Germany and was the poster child about good integration, but called a dictator his president as german. After critics, tried the racism card and now has turkish right wing tatoos.Good player, bad workrate and really dumb.",reddit,

He is just a scumbag,reddit,
1. Accused of being lazy 2. Made a post calling out China for their treatment of the local Muslim population. Arsenal didn’t have his back and the fans called him “political” 3. Open “support” of Erdogan. 4. Accused the DFB of Islamophobia 5. Refused to cut his wages during the pandemic I like Ozil and think that some of these accusations lack context and are circunstancial at best. Football Iconic made a really great video about Ozil that I highly recommendhttps://youtu.be/8dIQ56YACvE?si=fgADRHdiCkqG387P,reddit,
 Supported a dictator. Called him “My President”.He wasn’t really a revolutionary player. A classic playmaker that lacked consistency to be considered one of the true greats.,reddit,
 He's the antisemitic bream.,reddit,
"He acted like a man child at Arsenal aswell. Managed to turn the narrative on his side that the only issue Arsenal had with him is the Uighur stuff. That was a shit move from our club but he had massive issues here prior. He was a big reason Emery got sacked because Emery hated his attitude and began benching him, but Ozil turned the squad against him instead.Freddie also openly criticised him and Arteta also became fed up with his attitude in the end and finally cast him out. He sat on a monstrous contract he wasn’t justifying and was a big part of our shit locker room mentality but he always had god tier PR that made him look the victim no matter what.",reddit,
Nice guy until he posed with Erdoghan and turned fascist,reddit,
Outwardly support an absolute right wing nut job politician.,reddit,
" I mean, he's a hypocrite. You play for the German national team and then after you are out of favour you turn out to be a Turkish nationalist? So far that you get a gray wolves tattoo.Only ultra nationalists and some fenerbahce fans are buying that tbh.",reddit,
 Got a tattoo of a facist organisation,reddit,
 His political ideology doesn’t align with the Westerners.,reddit,
I remember when Germany played against turkey on a Wednesday. He was injured allegedly. But then at the next Saturday he played again for Real Madrid. He is the most opportunistic player ever.,reddit,
People don’t like him because of his political opinions as they act like they’re experts in Turkish politics. As a player I can agree people would consider his mentality weak or unprofessional,reddit,
"Political matters. Had a picture with the Turkish president 2 months before the 2018 World Cup , where Germany as a whole messed up the entire tournament , and got blamed for the disaster. Then expressed his support to Uyghur Turks which leaves Chinese under blame , who had a huge chunk of stocks at Arsenal, which ruined it entirely for him",reddit,
 Openly supporting any right-wing politician = cancelled. That’s all you need to know.,reddit,
 He was honest about his political beliefs unlike almost every other footballer and got hatred for not apologising like Gundo did. He also had a ‘lazy’ play style that is a lightning rod for criticism unless you’re winning every game.,reddit,
"Had a close relationship with Turkish president (dictator) Erdogan, supported a far right Turkish terrorist group, acted like a Turkish nationalist but refused to join Turkish National team and he lied about it saying he wasnt invited to the Turkish National team, also accused his german teammates of racism, when he arrived at Turkey he was really underwhelming at Fenerbahce then ended his career at Istanbul Basaksehir (A team that is owned by president Erdogan and his far right buddies)",reddit,
Because he supports a boarderline terrorist.,reddit,
 Never moved faster than a light jog and couldn't tackle,reddit,
The moment he showed his Muslim identity he became public enemy for the bigots and Islamophobes. Including Arsenal reprimanding him for speaking out against the plight of the Uighurs at the hands of the Chinese government.,reddit,
He advocated for muslims in Uyghur. And you know how the prem is. If you support a blue eyed and blond haired human being you’re good but how dare you support a muslim terrorist right?,reddit,
" In terms of being underrated on the pitch, just his casual and undemonstrative body language. Everything was so elegant he made it look simple and easy, whereas someone like Connor Gallagher steams around crashing into people and cant pass it ten yards but is lauded as a team player.In terms of hatred almost certainly rooted in Racism and Islamaphobia. He famoulsy said when i win Im German when i lose im Turkish. He called out the inhumane treatment or Uighur Mulsims in China when Arsenal did a promotional tour there which was the end of that relationship.He is a great footballer and human, among the most philanthropic out there.",reddit,
Germans are S tier racists and don't consider anyone who is not white as germans. They have learnt to hide their true self but sometimes they show their true colours.,reddit,
I mean Germany does have a history of racism and discrimination.,reddit,
"he didnt had the mental capacity to overcome racist slurs he was facing. dunno why he didnt turn to some professional support etc. to overcome it and then had some faux pas like the erdogan pic for what he got critics but combined with the racial/german turkophobia it was a grossly exaggerated reaction from german medias/germany overall. now they had a reason to be dismissive and hateful. it was justified now and didnt need any implications or between the lines to slur him. and imo he lost the overview and instead on focusing what he had he tried to compensate it with turkeypholia aka ""now more than ever"" because his homeland kinda didnt feel home-ish. latest downfall is his grey wolf tattoo. they are a turkish right-wing extremist movement. he is a grown man and is responsible for it by himself. but imo it is pretty sure that the systematic german turkophoby gave him the kick in that direction. ""OG germans dont like it when (turkish) migrants sit at the same table with them. they are used migrants/deutschtürken stay on the floor"" is what a migration researcher once said. now obviously there is (more) change but during özil s rise it was more than ever present. it was that generation that didnt depend/want depend/needed to depend on low income jobs like their parents/grandparents. gündogan is an example that overcame that system. i am more than sure he had to suck up a lot of german bullshit in order to stay where he is now. özil on the other hand is now just a shallow shell of turkish propaganda. That's there so low profile germany football ""analysts"" can dismisse his past influence and success.to say how exagerated german media was on özil. neuer once sang a croatian nazi song during his croatia holiday. 0 consequences or public apologies. gundogan didnt only apologize he had to openly prove ""his loyalty to germany"". özil didnt want to bow too low and tried to explain it.",reddit,
"People are soft and dont really understand people nor politics, easily triggered, misinformed etc.. also not to mention the whole turks in germany situation, incompatible cultures and all that. It really doesnt matter, Ozil is one of the most attractive mids that ever played, i enjoyed every minute of his field time. Long live Ozil!",reddit,
 He spoke facts.,reddit,
 He called out China for the uigher issue..China buys and sponsors alot of arsenals stuff.,reddit,
" Being lazy on the pitch. And it’s not a myth either. There are numerous examples from highlights alone where you can pin at least a portion of the blame on Ozil for not bothering to track back or just dangling out a lazy leg. The Bayern thrashings were the perfect example of this. One or two goals where he lets Robben come inside, drift past him, then just jogs back at a snail’s pace.",reddit,
 He reminds me of Berbatov.Amazing skills but seemingly no effort.Some of his assists were crazy good.,reddit,
" Yeah he wasn't the most professional, plus he's been controversial on his political views. It's a shame, because talent-wise he's definitely one of my favorite players. I don't care much for Real Madrid but I got an Özil jersey just because I was fascinated with him.",reddit,
I felt he was very lazy.,reddit,
"As a player from my understanding, his downfall at Arsenal was people wanted him to track back but he never did that in Germany or Madrid. People dislike his politics",reddit,
 It was so disappointing,reddit,
 [deleted],reddit,
 Nobody hates him all at all. Calling out an over rated player is not hate,reddit,
"I understand people may not like him as a person but just like with actors I kinda like to stick to what they do as a professional, he's a football player you either like him on the pitch or you don'tIdc who their best friends are or their political opinions",reddit,
" Man just stopped playing football at a semi-decent level... He could've done so much more but wasted his time and picked up his wages... Him and Hazard... Both were EXCELLENT players, don't get it twisted... Could say the same for Bale... Just coasting, picking up money and offering very little",reddit,
 he preferred to act like a German during his early career and prime time and then decided to act like a Turkish when he got old/ his career started to decline. This is because he knew that he would benefit from being German in his very first years (German national team is far superior)and then he was acting like he rememberred who he actually was.,reddit,
" I think you should look up the definition of revolutionary.He was good at his best, but he didn't change the way the game was played.",reddit,
" A superb athlete loses all motivation upon achieving quite a lot to be fair. Mou read it early enough to boot him to Arsenal where he somewhat revitalized his ambition but petered out quickly. Also, his nonchalant body language was viewed by fans as a sign of not caring enough for the game and the team. Similarly, Berbatov and Arshavin were hated for their ""laziness"". But there is a room for players with this approach to the game and it is exactly why they find time and space to find that killer pass or a flick of a ball to leave the opponents frozen. On top of that you have your political and societal bullshit that only takes away from athletes than anything else.",reddit,
That stupid Axel F song.,reddit,
His entire career was based on a four week decent bit of form at the world cup,reddit,
Well it’s more the fact he exists really,reddit,
" He’s conservative and a nationalist, something Reddit user do not like.",reddit,
 Sorry can somoneExplain precisely what the grey wolves are.Confirm that the tattoo is specificly endorsing the grey wolve causeOr have any documented evidence of Ozil endorsing fascist or right ing ideology.,reddit,
Was a solid human being and muslimPeople hate that,reddit,
"“Revolutionary”? Not really, zero teams came knocking for him. Zero.",reddit,
"Ozil posed for a picture with the Erdogan that was captioned MY PRESIDENT, as you know, Erdogan is Turkish. Then, QA he called out the Chinese government for the genocide of the Ughur Muslim minority, which caused China to pressure Adidas into dropping him and letting it be known that no matches featuring him would ever be shown in China.....",reddit,
 You mean aside from being the single laziest defensive player in the modern era (and that’s including MLS Messi) AND supporting a fascist???Other than that I can’t really think of anything.,reddit,
He has some views that the Western world dont agree with and people have since used those to justify hate and amplify his other apparent flaws. Its certainly overblown and a lot of other players are free from criticism for similar views/actions with their nation & heritage. Being nationalistic and right wing isnt something unique to Ozil - many footballers are but none get the hate like Ozil.Shitting on Muslims is trendy and closet Islamaphobia probably play a part too.,reddit,
Overrated player for a guy who couldn't score goals or defend.,reddit,
 Lack speed.,reddit,
" Stupid people will always look for reason to hate on someone. Ozil is a footballer and a fantastic one, and football is the only thing that matters. Everything else is just celebrity gossiping.",reddit,
Played for arsenal,reddit,
 1. Received German hate for taking Pic and supporting Erdogan2. Received hate from China for supporting Uyghur Muslims. Arsenal had to sideline him fearing they would lose the Chinese fans and their market in the future,reddit,
 His eyes were offside,reddit,
" Grew up in Germany, profited off the German system, became rich in Germany. Continued by supporting a dictator who at the time (and still) was very, very anti-Germany, calling us Nazis for not allowing him to do his election campaign in Germany. Did not apologize for basically calling a foreign president ""his president"", a man who hates Germans. Instead, Ozil said that everyone was racist and islamophobic. Then, he got the tattoo of a fascist organization (which is against Jews and also Christianity, something not really popular here anymore).Lastly, he still only holds the German passport while living in Turkey, acting Turkish. Just a hypocrite, a racist, and a stupid person overall.",reddit,
 He played for arsenal,reddit,
" Fascist supporter, like Neymar.",reddit,
He spoke against china's policy on the uyghurs,reddit,
 turky stuff,reddit,
"Lives as free and secular as possible, supports radical Islamists in Turkey.",reddit,
"Özil was a slightly frustrating player to watch. I thought Arsenal fans were too harsh on his performances, but I do understand the frustration. He looked like he wasn't trying, he calmly walked up to the ball and tried a little flick. The brilliance of him doing this was that, at least sometimes, he would look bored and not interested as he played a perfect 25 yard pass. By only looking at Özil, it would be impossible to predict what he was about to do.",reddit,
