so Lukaku and Mbappe are the cookers of the euro lmaooooooooki,youtube,0
Considering Belgium history I'm surprised so many black players choose to represent them,youtube,0
I can see Lukaku playing for arsenal Arteta should consider him,youtube,0
Lukaku has now scored the 3rd-most goals by a European - he's just one behind the late great Ferenc Puskas,youtube,0
Lukaku the flat track bully.<br>Invisible against real quality.,youtube,1
What makes Azerbaijan...mm................European? Next well have Saudi and Quatar in The 'European Cup'..?? ....its fuccin crazy lol,youtube,1
What a player lukaku is chelsea are mad for getting rid of him doku just gets better and better with each game both for club and country 👏,youtube,0

Belgium a threat for Euros they'll slaughter England,youtube,0
1 that keeper is absolutely shite and 2 that was clearly offside,youtube,1
lakaka chokes when the games a serious all this other small games with no pressure hes good at shining,youtube,0
I be pissed if i was lukaku get taken off at half time i would want records of most goals by single player at euro qualifier,youtube,0
Lukaku making history. Like him or not he sets records. So happy for him. 4 goals within the first 45 mins is no small achievement. 👏,youtube,0
JUST A SHAME HE ISN'T BELGIAN 😮,youtube,0
Belgium is now a young squad. There are some good players. For the moment Tedesco has been play8ng around a lot and trying a lot of different tactics and players. So grom there we can have a good surprise or a bad surprise with that team.,youtube,0
Well very similar to previous performance in the pass in group stage bullying some weaker teams when facing some stronger teams in the knockout stage it'll be another story.<br>Anyway congratulations to Lukaku and Belgium hope they can keep up with the performance,youtube,0
when shit lukaku scores this many goals u just know Azerbaijan must be extremely shit,youtube,1
Lukaku is very good but he never seems to perform when it actually matters.,youtube,0

Isn't Belgium in Europe? They look like a team from Africa,youtube,1
Why Azerbaijan even playing in euro qualification when there next to Iran ffs and also free karabakh from Azerbaijan karabakh is Armenia. Why nobody protest or talk about this war,youtube,1

I think Belgium will be somewhat of an unknown quantity going into the Euros. A lot of their old guard is gone and it's going to be interesting to see how some of the youngsters perform.,youtube,0
He’s moaning about the second yellow he’s very lucky it wasn’t a straight red,youtube,0

Italy and England is like 1 sided rivalry for England Italy is an extremley tough opponent a football giant with 6 trophies that they just can never seem to defeat except in non important games like Friendlies and for Italy they see England as a small team with only 1 trophy from 1966 and whenever they face in a major tournament it's an automatic victory for Italy despite England being capable of bringing Italy to a penalty shootout like if they face in a group stage it's an automatic 3 points for Italy if they face in a Quarter-final it's an automatic qualification to the next round for Italy and if they face in a final then Italy automatically wins the trophy,youtube,0

I was pessimistic that day. i was on the beach watching the mach. to England's goal I simply said we're the seconds of europe that's okay. but then. something clicked a sort of pride 'let's show the queen we can conquer britain at their home.<br>the rest is history.,youtube,0
The fact that Maguire the worst cb in the premier league was more composed and scored an amazing penalty while the 3 biggest front prospects missed is astounding to me but in a funny way,youtube,0
Why would you let an overrated English teenager take the last and decisive penalty on a world stage like this lol??!! They deserve to lose on this one alone.,youtube,1
There was no doubt in this match that the two best penalty takers in the stadium were going to score. Very good penalties from Kane and Maguire.,youtube,0
if Saka scored...,youtube,0
Put this into my veins.,youtube,0
Harry Maguire 😂😂,youtube,0
THE GOAT OF ENGLAND HARRY MAGUIRE 🐐🐐,youtube,0
Poor Pickford he has done all what he can but still not enough,youtube,0
A gift to legend Gianluca Vialli,youtube,0
Donnarumma 🗿🗿,youtube,0
It’s coming rome,youtube,0
This Never GEts Old though JOrginho should have been replaced who would cost them making World Cup missing PK too.  Putting guys in the 120th minute who don't belong on the pitch really worked out.  Italy had that happen where guy they subbed in at like 120th missed the PK leading to a loss too :).  Reminds me of 2012 when England gets crossbar after Buffon dove the wrong way. That is still better than getting the post on the ground when guy is laying on ground :).  Man when I played we wouldn't even be on team if took PKs like most these guys.  All this BS instead of just picking a corner with velocity or side. Even right at the goalie scores more than trying to be cute.  When up 2 1 gotta just get it on net at very least ;).  Glad Italy Finally Won :).,youtube,0
Rashford and Marquinhos both hit the left post,youtube,0
When you miss a penalty that even Harry maguire scores,youtube,0
english is double harry scorred,youtube,0
notice the only people that scored that night were named harry,youtube,0
Best euro final,youtube,0
And now Italy 1-2 England hahahaha.,youtube,0

Donnaruma just walked and said  it’s too EZ for me…🥶 🥶 🥶,youtube,0

Italy : Wins championship through penalties,youtube,0
If Marcus Rashford had made that penalty England would have won. Would have kept the pressure on Italy,youtube,0
Rushford is the only way,youtube,0
Still can't believe Maguire (the goat of defending) took a pen and scored it,youtube,0

England would have needed David Seaman!,youtube,0
Saka’s miss was heartbreaking,youtube,0
Respect for harry maguire,youtube,0
The fact that this team has not played in 2 WCs blows my mind. <br>I remember how chiesa turned prime messi and destroyed England. Shame he couldn't score the winner penalty.,youtube,0

Italia is number one in the world of racist 😠,youtube,1
Golazo de súper mario,youtube,0
SAY NO TO RACISM <br>IT HAS NO PLACE IN FOOTBALL,youtube,0
Yeah  but can he do it in a cold rainy night in Stoke?,youtube,0
Bah...,youtube,0
Pazzesco Balo!!,youtube,0
Forza Balotelli!!!! Serie A kick all the racist fans out penalize the teams do something instead of denying and moving on. It's time. This needs to stop.,youtube,0
World class goal...also love his plyng style...he s a great man..,youtube,0
He scored this after being racially abused and threatening to walk off during the game.,youtube,0
Serie A fans full of idiots racism screaming everywhere,youtube,1
World class goal. Hope that can shut the racist fan up,youtube,0
Beutiful,youtube,0
Honestly I don’t understand why no top team would take a chance and sign him clearly he’s still has quality,youtube,0
This might not be read by a lot of people but Balotelli will have one of his best moments in his late years in his career. It might not be in terms of stats but a better outlook of things in the sport. He looks more humble and contained hopefully that comes with more wisdom. A well seasoned Veteran he is becoming.,youtube,0
Why he took early retirement from national team ?,youtube,0
COME AND GO,youtube,0
He still got it!!!!,youtube,0
This man is so talented,youtube,0
Super Mariyo,youtube,0
balotelli should play for ac milan again,youtube,0
Too quick even for the camera 👌,youtube,0

Super Mario Balotelli!,youtube,0
Super Mario!!!,youtube,0
Super top Mario Balotelli!,youtube,0
They forgot to mark him🤦🏾‍♂️😂,youtube,0
Brilliant! The goalkeeper was on that side as well.,youtube,0
Balotelli to juventus. Its the perfect time we need a cf to exchange games with higuain. Balotelli is now super experienced and will be motivated to play with Ronaldo and co up front,youtube,0
He taught those disgusting racists a lesson don't mess with super Mario.,youtube,0
He responded well to racism here. Racist Italy Racist Serie A,youtube,1
Bravo Mario,youtube,0
Amazing gol... The problem is that defense of Brescia is a disaster.!!,youtube,0
Why Always Me? Hats off 💪🏻,youtube,0
🇮🇹🖕🏽,youtube,1
Serie A doesn't really care about racism thats the truth.<br>While everyone feel they had to do something significant yet this channel only capable of liking every comment about Mario and the goal. Disgusting. I'll never watch the league again anymore.,youtube,0
No to racism!!<br>Please stop.,youtube,0
No to Racism ! Italian Fans Always Do This,youtube,1
Lalotelli,youtube,0
Come on!!!!,youtube,0
Super Mario still the best Italian striker with has back to goal,youtube,0
That guy casually strolling back from offside when his team is behind made me really angry for some reason.,youtube,0
This guy’s striking technique is still top class,youtube,0
And they say America's racist lol,youtube,1
Fans got what they deserved,youtube,0
Shut all the racists up. ✅👑,youtube,0
20 sec unskippable ad for a video less than one minute. Seria A racist nonces,youtube,0

That alex krul strike gave me kean vibes😂,youtube,0
In this day and age modric dont really be gettin mentiond y hes one of the best midfielders in the world even now he needs to get some more recognition in my opnion,youtube,0
Wait 😮 why did Real Madrids third goal look like Fifa Animations 😂,youtube,0
Next penalty Bellingham should take it it's ridiculous that they've missed 3 in a row,youtube,0
Real need a striker ASAP.I'll leave it as that.,youtube,0
Joselu 2 goals or not  awful,youtube,0
RM equaliser for 1-1 was def a foul.,youtube,0
Haha Berlins first goal a handball no? watch it back slowly. I must be some kind of deluded as nobody seems to mention it. Yeah looking back it seemed to be Vázquez' hand so maybe that's why.,youtube,0
42 millions for 6 wins and for qualifying..the best team from the world..Real Madrid,youtube,0
It’s amazing how Real Madrid unlike other big teams can have good players who aren’t elite or world class just good and yet still feel like a favourite for the champions league. In very few other elite clubs would players like Vazquez Nacho ceballos remain for as long as they have and a player like Joselu actually perform to the levels he seems to when he’s needed,youtube,0
I think UB deserved a draw at the very least shame!,youtube,0
1st Real goal clearly a foul.,youtube,0
Saying Real Madrid thought they'd cracked the code might not be too welcome in Berlin 😂,youtube,0
Real Madrid definitely will get knocked out by someone big in the knockouts ❤,youtube,0
What a game the stadium’s great too,youtube,0
that header goal if a player has his hands on shoulders keeping a player down is that not a foul in the game? cause that guy had his arm pressed across the back of the defenders neck keeping him from jumping never mind from looking upwards,youtube,0
That stadium is horrendous 😂 it look straight out off the Soviet Union 😂 so sad,youtube,1
Union are back,youtube,0
What a game,youtube,0
Joselu passion for each goal he scores for Madrid is unmatched 🔥,youtube,0
Its crazy how many ex Stoke players are in top teams now lol,youtube,0
How does Lucas Vasquez play for real I’ll never know,youtube,1
Who's no 14 for Real Madrid ? its the second time I'm watching their UCL Highlights and its like they've found their own Chelsea version of Timo Werner. Im not sure they can win a UCL with him upfront. seems to take him 5 chances to bury a goal. Is he in for Vini who i heard was injured during international duty ?,youtube,1
im sure we were all on berlin's side for this really wish they clutched out the win,youtube,0
I had both Bellingham's to score last night didn't expect it to be Jude to let me down.,youtube,0
How on Earth was this match tied at 2-2 with 88 minutes to go?   Real Madrid had so many chances.   However Real Madrid kept going and got the win.,youtube,0
Modric miss the penalty,youtube,0
They need CR7 for penalties.  3 missed by real Madrid already,youtube,0
CEBALLOS? Gave me the maddest ptsd from the covid era.,youtube,0
Bellingham is a proper  baller  sheer quality.,youtube,0
Who’s stadium?,youtube,0
I wanted bellingham to score but at least he got an assist at the end,youtube,0
Can’t except everyone to be happy🤷‍♂️,youtube,0
Can’t except everyone to be happy🤷‍♂️,youtube,0
Can’t except everyone to be happy🤷‍♂️,youtube,0
I'm happy for Joselu scoring but that first goal for RM tonight was definitely an offensive foul how not?,youtube,0
Ace game,youtube,0
Joselu for Ballond'or,youtube,0
Arsenal could beat Madrid i reckon,youtube,0
I love the fact that TNT actually show the full highlights not 1 minute clips like sky,youtube,0
Clueless people calling foul on Joselu's 1st goal. Berlin player tried to drag him before ball was played & when Joselu was in the air with left hand on the shoulder his other arm was dragged down by Berlin player trying to stop him like a judo slam.,youtube,0
We taking season by season lightly. It's now a norm to tie or even loose.I miss the 2014 era where we couldn't afford to loose<br>I think barca going down making us relax a bit.If this goes on and Barcelona sinks we might have to face atletico and Valencia and possibly that girona with loaned players taking the league.,youtube,0
Union celebrating like that when they need another goal. Prats,youtube,1
That Real equaliser is a foul like,youtube,0
Ridiculous from the union defender to grab joselu like that. Deservedly got climbed over like a prat,youtube,1
Belingham winning the CL guys.,youtube,0
Joselu?.....couldn't hit a barn door in the premier league....just saying...,youtube,0
Whoever makes the thumbnails needs sacking,youtube,0
Commentators are so funny. Bellingham inches away. Apparently miles away another strike was so close 2 yards away. Lol,youtube,0
I remember saying when Barcelona beat Real Madrid in a pre season friendly that Barca might win the league by 20 points because Benzema left 💀💀💀 how wrong I was ffs 🤦,youtube,0
What an atmosphere. Much respect for union Berlin fans,youtube,0
Fantastic Madrid it's another level,youtube,0
first goal for real was foul jesus christ that push in cl,youtube,0

First RM goal was a blatant foul. Can’t get more obvious than that. It’s not like they need the help.,youtube,0
Did that first RM goal not even get looked at?,youtube,0
Im so confused why our manager put in almost a full squad in this game i was hoping to see our youngster play however its a nice win,youtube,0
First Madrid goal is a pretty obvious foul no? Hands all over the defender who cant even jump because of it,youtube,0
No one speak about Ancellotti? The best coach ever. Absolutely legend at his age..,youtube,0
Jude is phenomenal! Zidane was nowhere near this standard at his age! There srent many who have been!,youtube,0
Union Berlin stadium seems like a dark castle<br>It gives out an intimidating sensation that I can’t explain. Similar to galatasary,youtube,0
Ngl that's low quality game 😂,youtube,0
That Bellingham ball for the saved Rodrygo header was outrageous. So nonchalant and casual.,youtube,0
Thanks for saving my bet,youtube,0
❤,youtube,0
If Reals first goal had missed or been saved it would have been a stone wall penalty for sure,youtube,0
Might be some of the worst finishing I’ve seen from Real Madrid up there with Rafa tonight,youtube,0
Joselu reminds me of nunez tries his best until he finally scores😂,youtube,0
I suppose I'm unlucky? But at least I had Real Madrid to win (1-3) <br>Great Football 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽,youtube,0
Madrid - the team of miracles,youtube,0
well played!,youtube,0
Some really weak defending from Real tonight.,youtube,0
fault at Joselu's first goal,youtube,0
Corrupt officials in favour of Madrid..AGAIN their goal climbing all over the defender obvious foul but referee not interested… disgusting!!!!!,youtube,1
That pitch is just sad,youtube,0
Union Berlin the most unlucky team in ucl this year,youtube,0
Bellingham is everywhere,youtube,0
Great season for Joselu he deserves it!,youtube,0
Dani Ceballos still plays football lol. One of the worst players in lockdown for arsenal 😂,youtube,1
Commentators should stop this “how has he not scored” nonsense…,youtube,0
what’s funny?,youtube,0
Madrid beat team in Europe?,youtube,0
Does make one wonder just how weak that la Liga is when Real Madrid can win it more often than not and yet struggle against a Team such as Union Berlin.<br>Great game though :0),youtube,0
Both of England’s superstars getting winning assists - built different,youtube,0
Bellingham 🔥,youtube,0
This is Real Madrid 🤩,youtube,0
What a game no one except that!,youtube,0

Onana stuck to his line... 🤦‍♂️... Might aswell not have been there..,youtube,0
Kane is special his vision and passing is up there with the very best we've ever seen,youtube,0
Remember when people thought Kane would choose Utd 😂,youtube,0
United are good,youtube,0
Can i just say the fans were an absolute disgrace in the stadium. Why pay and come to the match just to be a spectator in a must win game. The Bayern fans were having a blast and could be heard louder than 70+ thousand fans. A joke stay at home if u cannot generate an atmosphere,youtube,1
Antony has to be a contender for the worst signing United have ever made,youtube,1
That goalkeeping was completely shocking on the goal. Made the finish so easy for him you’d expect the keeper to come out and put pressure one on one. Stays so far back was actually shocked seeing it live,youtube,0
Embarrassing from Man U and the money they have at their disposal to finish bottom of that group 🤣🤣,youtube,0
Entitled elitist & corporate prawn sandwiches deserve everything get!,youtube,1

Coman might be bayerns best player since robben and Ribery I swear the bloke always puts in a 7/10 in the champions league I definitely don’t watch every Bayern league match but he always looks class.,youtube,0
Does the keeper know hes allowed to come off his line 🤣,youtube,0
I do not believe it Man United loose again,youtube,0
Man u only shot on target was the 23rd minute and it came from a defender…,youtube,0
King Kane 👑,youtube,0
Ten Hag is out bruh,youtube,0
The unfortunate reality is that with some basic competent goalkeeping United would have already qualified from this group. They are still a pretty mediocre team though and Bayern looked like they didn't even have to try too hard to beat them.,youtube,0
ETH should be sacked for allowing scouse rats to talk their s**t. If we dont beat the rats by at least 3 goals hes got to get sacked.,youtube,1
Yesss am an old fan of Bayern and still support Bayern yess we beat man uited yesss,youtube,0
Old Trafford is falling down ten haag is a <b>*****</b> clown 🤡,youtube,1
Kamikazi'd would be more fitting than crashed.,youtube,0
Commentary is absolute bobbins though as always,youtube,0
As a Celtic fan I can only imagine we'll be exactly like Man Utd tonight. Changed days from both teams doing well in Europe. Man Utd were always competing for every trophy when I was younger now look at them. Strange stuff.,youtube,0
Kane assist 🔥🔥🔥,youtube,0
Maguire comes off and they concede 😅,youtube,0
Who TF are Man Utd….😂,youtube,0
How bad are Man Utd honestly smh,youtube,0
Haha small club.,youtube,0
United are a football  team as any other they do not have a right to be in any competition unless they are good enough obviously that is not the case now so stop whinging  and get on with it exaggerated wages are killing clubs and football it’s about time wages were paid on appearance bonuses along with a set wage across all leagues of the world .,youtube,0
Halifax team better than UTD 💰💰💰💰💰,youtube,0
Why does Onana always stay on his line man.,youtube,0
Musiala is a baller! England missed a trick there...,youtube,0
The Glaser are toxic.<br>How many cups or championship have ManU won under their ownership?<br>About 2?<br>And how much money they've borrowed?<br>Billions?,youtube,0
It was like watching a testimonial match. Bayern never even got out of first gear it was that easy for them,youtube,0
The loudest the home fans got was to boo United. Shocking atmosphere again,youtube,0
theyre still in the conference wdym,youtube,0
Farmers harvesting,youtube,0
Loved how Sane celebrated before the goal was scored,youtube,0
Why’s Onana stood on his line for the goal?!?! Get out and make a challenge at least man!!! Joke of a club 😂😂😂😂,youtube,0
The quicker man utd fans and all the pundits realise that they are just a mediocre mid table club the better. Their glory days are long behind them,youtube,1
TNT making fun of united. Life has peeked,youtube,0
Mctominay another sh.. performance,youtube,1
I continue to be enchanted by United's exquisite failure.,youtube,0
How does ten hah still didnt get the sack,youtube,0
Funny thing is people are shouting tuchel out in munich for this bad performance only beating united 1-0 is unacceptable for them that is their standard ☠️united on the other hand..,youtube,0
anyone else see onana fall over for the goal?,youtube,0
united struggling without Howard Webb...lol,youtube,0
Bye bye United 👋🏽😂🤣🤣,youtube,0
I've thought for a very long time that no manager has got a chance while they allow AF to lord it over and put even more pressue on them by always hanging around.<br>No doubt about him being a decent manager but was a bully of the highest order especially against weak and pathetic referees of his day and how they allowed it to happen to them I will never know.<br>Keep going Mr F.,youtube,0
watching man u fans boo their team over a loss to bayern ...man u fans are part of their problem,youtube,0

Crazy how Bayern won the game but the whole commentary focused on man United when they lost,youtube,0
I’m not saying Obana would have saved it  but he did everything to make it as easy as possible to score,youtube,0
"How often does Darren Fletcher say ""And there's the chance..""",youtube,0
How embarrassing,youtube,0
We can only hope that Ten Hag and his team keep up this amazing work they're doing at Utd 😂😂😂,youtube,0
Most pitiful performance of the night in CL Utd out with a whimper,youtube,0

It's a pity the utd fan's didn't have the same energy for the GLAZER'S OUT MOVEMENT than they do for the ETH OUT MOVEMENT PATHETIC.,youtube,0

Man Utd a team of couldn’t really care less just take the money players. I can’t believe how far this once great team has fallen. 😢,youtube,0
City top their group and Glazers United bottom of their group. Sounds about right.,youtube,0
That was killer assist by Kane.,youtube,0
Man u slowly dying,youtube,0
"Now United can concentrate on the ""We stopped Liverpool scoring at Anfield"" cup. The mighty all conquering swashbuckling entertainers Manchester United have finally become the new Everton.",youtube,1
wow onana 😮 never before can I say one player has cost manu in this group stage so many continuous errors in games in a position that didn’t need changing 😢,youtube,0
Hahahaha united fans really thought they did something when they finished 4th last year 😂😂😂,youtube,0
As an Arsenal fan I'm still bitterly disappointed in MU.They were once a team most if not all teams use to fear.,youtube,0
What is the keeper doing!!! LOL,youtube,0
Apparently Man U are having numbers printed on the front of their shirts for their next game to make it look like they’re attacking all the time.,youtube,0
what a pass by Kane amazing,youtube,0
Only top 4 united will make,youtube,0

Napoli had their moments but overall Inter is far superior this season.,youtube,0
The inter passing was just beautiful,youtube,0
Hakan Calhanoglu 🚀!! What was that man? The way the ball getting far away from the goalkeeper more and more as it goes was phenomenal. It was pleasure to my eyes. 👏,youtube,0
Forza Inter,youtube,0
Last season Napoli showed a defense like an impenetrable wall conceding the fewest goals. Minjae Kim left and the team now has an average defense.,youtube,0
Lautaro's foul on Lobotka not called by the referee resulted in Inter's goal two minutes from the end of the half up until then Napoli was the better team and that episode changed the whole game in Inter favour that goal could give Inter the championship in the long run,youtube,0
Forza inter 💙🖤💙🖤 from Indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩,youtube,0
Alhamdulillah.<br>What a stunner from Hakan!,youtube,0
This commentator is so biased towards Inter as a neutral fan it makes it really grating to watch.,youtube,0
Napoli sold Kim and bought Natan!😂 The guy is one of the worst defenders in serie A. They bought average players after winning the title !,youtube,0
Why aren't the Napoli players passing the ball to osimhen?,youtube,0
Napoli didn't deserve to lose a draw would have been a fair result.,youtube,0

Was Kane the only one who scored? No? You’d think so by every Bayern game thumbnail,youtube,0
They have to utilise kane more at champions league level. Sane and coman may be able to run around galatasary and those other mooks at bundesliga level. But up against quality defenders who know how to deal with pace theyl do nothing. Hes there to score and provide so do it bayern wont win at this level hogging the ball and trying to be clever all the time.,youtube,1
Musiala 👏👏,youtube,0
Can a Bayern fan please tell me what is Coman and Sane's beef with kane all about? Seem pretty chill to pass it amongst themselves but when its Kane all of a sudden hes invisible to them. Can't help but think Kane would so much rather be at spurs rn than this Bayern team as good as they are no disrespect.,youtube,0
Kane would be getting 4 goals a game if his team bloody passed to him. Imagine being top scorer feeding off scraps,youtube,1
"""have that"" someones fired up :D",youtube,0
Happy for Kane !! Looks like he’s enjoying himself,youtube,0
Icardi panenka 😍,youtube,0
We played horrible in that first half. Galatasaray should be annoyed not to walk away with suttin and Sane had a absolute stinker,youtube,1
Galatassary fans are always saying they are the best club in the world when they aren't good thing there team got humbled,youtube,0
Galatasaray played suicidal and defending was on the shoulders of four players so Bayer easily exploited the numerical advantage in attack.,youtube,0
first 55 minutes it looked very promising for Galatasaray but after subs it just started to crash. If Kerem Akturkoglu had a better finishing he would have been playing for any PL team. It was very entertaining game to watchGs li degilim,youtube,0
Have that says the neutral commentator after the third goal lol,youtube,0
Kane and Bellingham I see can’t stop scoring goals 😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉,youtube,0
The title says Clinical Kane but then the commentator says that he's been misfiring all night 🤣,youtube,0
If Sane some minor aspects to his game like finding the right pass and keeping in his negative attitude then he would be a great player,youtube,0
If kane continues in this current form Ballon D'Or,youtube,0
bro who is this commemtator hes so boring it sends me to sleep xD. he should be a golf commentator,youtube,0
Might as well stop running if Sane has the ball. He won’t pass.,youtube,0
If any of u actually watched the match galatasaray did very well amazing pressure but ultimately got tired. First half we dominated all the way up to 70th min then 75th min we conceded everyone was tired bayern defending then towards the end they walked through us..,youtube,0
sane is some player,youtube,0
Bayern might have the world's best attack rn but they need to fix that goalkeeper,youtube,0
First half Bayern couldn't touch the ball. Galatasaray played amazing until the 75th minute. Then they got tired and Bayern got the lead. Quality of the players but most importantly their conditions gave them a free win. In my opinion Gala deserved to win - at least draw - but this is champions league. Congrats to Bayern.,youtube,0
Those pricks ain’t team players and the manager needs to put a rocket up their arses.We know who they are they need to start passing to their striker and this team would score a lot more goals.This team won’t win this trophy as ego is more important than team.,youtube,1
If G.S defance didn't make defensive  error it was going to be different  story.,youtube,0
Thought Galatasary by them highlights deserved a point should have scored more but didnt take them!,youtube,0
Something about Kane reminds me of Bobby Charlton. Even if he's not quite on the same technical level (who is) Kane shares the deep sense of humility the workmanlike approach and the fearsome clinical finish.,youtube,0
The commentary 😅,youtube,0
Sane one selfish player -,youtube,1
Kane is on another level,youtube,0
Kane keeps it simple and makes it look easy the other lads look like the skilled players at school that wont ever pass,youtube,0
What was this recorded on an iPhone???,youtube,0
Bayern players need to realize that Kane would have scored from that angle for the musiala goal but instead he passed the ball because he isn't selfish and also knows  what to be done at the right time,youtube,0
Would love to see galatasray go far in the tournament they have a good team,youtube,0
GS should have buried this game by half time.. good to watch,youtube,0
"""Have that"" 😂",youtube,0
bayern defence is still a bit open at times,youtube,0
Lets hope Bayern sell that sané and the other greedy players and bring in players who are gonna less selfish and more a team player.,youtube,1
Nice of them to get Alan Partridge on commentary duty.,youtube,0
Gala destoryed bayern until 72nd minute Shouldve made changes around 65 min as some defenders were lacking a bit along midfield Was a great fun game to whatch,youtube,0
Gala dominated the gane but are way to delicate off the ball,youtube,0
Bayern won with the luck factor. Galatasaray played better from start to finish,youtube,0
Bayern wasn’t exist till 75 there was Galata show but no finishing so this is how football works.,youtube,0
What a improvement Kane is over mane,youtube,0
worse commentating ever XD,youtube,1
Akturkoglu misses so much. An easy win becomes a loss I hope he does go to Tottenham or Arsenal,youtube,0
Galatasaray should of been 4-1 up,youtube,0
The world will now understand why 'Mane' left..... it's a shame 😕,youtube,0
Galata had so many chances..pff,youtube,0
If a player doesn’t want to pass to Harry that’s fine. Just hand in 😊your transfer request and leave. Simples.,youtube,0
Haha,youtube,0
“Have that!” - The Commentator😂😂,youtube,0
Honestly Galatasaray played really well. Just no luck,youtube,0
Bayern did not play in well but they always showed the different class.,youtube,0
Kane is the best striker in the WORLD. SIMPLE,youtube,0
This Akturkoglu guy can’t shoot.. he gets into incredible positions but he misses far too much .. he should have scored at least twice … they need to send him to a finishing school,youtube,0
Kane played for Tottenham.<br>Tottenham is a Jewish club.<br>Kane now plays for Bayern.<br>Bayern is a German club.<br>Jews do not like Germany.<br>Jews gave Bayern Kane...with their best wishes...😂,youtube,0
Freedom to Cyprus! Cyprus is Greek,youtube,0
Kane & Bayern looking dangerous,youtube,0
Kane scored one basic simple sitter and all these people making a big deal about him but i think they are bots this cant be real lol,youtube,0
Harry Kane playing with a smile on his face...love it,youtube,0
Turks were good in the first twenty minutes. Bayern showed there class in the end though.,youtube,0
Lovely bit of Partridge on the commentary ‘have that’ after the 3rd goal. 👏,youtube,0
Sane selfish all the time  that's why I don't like him  hope is not going to come in Liverpool Amin..<br>Fair play from B.M,youtube,0
To many greedy players at Munich sane for one.,youtube,1
Ulreich is amazing! I'm proud he's stepped up,youtube,0
Give Tuchel halaand he will make him rubish,youtube,0
I always say Turchel never know how to use no.9All good no9 in his teams always look bad no service.,youtube,0
Davies is actually horrendous,youtube,1
Kane #1,youtube,0
Kane certainly doing very well with Bayern. Pleased for him.,youtube,0
Kane doing the most for Bayern,youtube,0
gala dominated the game until the second bayern goal they absolutely deserved to win this game but it was unlucky,youtube,0
With a title like Clinical Kane I was expecting more than 1 goal from Kane and not being in the 6 yard box for it,youtube,0
No one mentions Ulrich? What a keeper 😮,youtube,0
Mauro icardi breezer with a brilliant breezy pen,youtube,0
Bayer shouldn’t win this game they didn’t create chances it was lucky win,youtube,0
I was a fan of Bayern till they signed himm😂,youtube,0
Harry Kane is a excellent player. Surprisingly he hasn't won a trophy/medal. With him being at Bayern Munich he has got to get a trophy/medal this season,youtube,0
I think Kane is so good he would score even at Chelsea.,youtube,0
Galatasaray should have gone 3-1 upfront 1st half. They missed about 7 decent chances. Bayern was boxed in their half full 45 minutes with only a counter attack. <br>Bayern started showing their class only after 60-65 minute as Gala got tired. <br>I think Gala will lose the return leg in Germany too next. But will qualify  as they are the second best team in the group.,youtube,0
What a pen from icardi ❤🐐🐐,youtube,0
Kane is such an effective playmaker for a striker it's incredible. Nothing he does is particularly flashy but he's super efficient. The way he comes deep for the ball and plays it through or heads it onto his wingers is something he does better than anyone else. Bayern really need to find a way to give him service without him having to move out of position though if they want to win anything.,youtube,0
I hate harry kane,youtube,1
Mason mount and  HQjlund are the only players that are saving us,youtube,0
I can’t believe icardi missed a penalty but scored a normal goal,youtube,0
Icardi very underrated striker,youtube,0
Ugly mejbri,youtube,1
Man united's nightmare continues..!,youtube,0
Na onana… terrible,youtube,0
🦁 💛❤️🦁🦁GALA!!!,youtube,0
wtf was lindelof doing for that 3rd goal lol,youtube,0
Some finish for the winner by Icardi,youtube,0
Galatasaray played with Manchester United like cat<br>Play with mouse😂,youtube,0
I'm surprised a small club with average players like Man United are in the Champions League.,youtube,0
What even is this keeper😂 and wtf was rashford doing with that attempt on a sweaty goal 😂,youtube,1
That keeper is a liability,youtube,0
What happened to my team,youtube,0
Unless he gets better at the moment i think onana could be the worst gk signing in the last decade he has been abismal its like watching a cb trying to play in goal and even his passing and composure on the ball is getting worse,youtube,0
thats s how GALATASARAY wiped out the manchester united 😂😂,youtube,0
Glory hunters,youtube,0
Imagine being a glory hunter with a club who have won one trophy in 7 years? Glory hunters support their clubs to win trophies. Plastics are ruining football. Support your local club. That’s what football is really all about.,youtube,0
Such a shame for Rasmus to play so well on a losing side. He's gonna be a Man U legend. ❤,youtube,0
How did United lose that game lol.,youtube,0
onana is a joke. Marseille used to have a laughable keeper like him. Just making tons of mistakes and they kept him for years. Unbelievable.,youtube,1
bring back David de Gea Onana is over rated,youtube,0
Icardi is crazy good.,youtube,0
Sunderland AFC 👑.,youtube,0
real strikers do not lay the ball off when they get into positions like that they bury it. RASHFORD IS A TOTAL BOTTLER,youtube,1
And that's why André onana is the best goalkeeper in the solar system,youtube,0
Hojlund United's next Ronaldo.,youtube,0
brooo it's a mess in the defense.. they don't have a Roy Keane to scream at them.. they are probably giving Onana anxiety hahaha United would be great if it wasn't for the constant poor choices in defense... even the first goal.. Dalot tries to backheel the ball in that position.. it's like he doesn't care enough... if Roy Keane saw that he would've been checked instantly... the defense acts veeeeery superficial...,youtube,0
Gg,youtube,0
That’s the second time Casemiro has had to sacrifice himself for the shiteness of others.,youtube,1
Davinson Sanchez with a stormer of a game at the back and an assist for the winner 👍,youtube,0
I'd love to see onana's betting slips back home in Africa something is really fishy about the way he's kept goal since he came,youtube,1
This keeper is like something outside a chicken shop in Brixton. Bruno Fernandez is an absolute disgrace a waste of an underpants. Marcus rashford the biggest fraud ever to play for the club. Ten fags has some serious calls.,youtube,1
Hojlund looks like a cracking player,youtube,0
Gala ❤🧡,youtube,0
Onana is a terrible keeper,youtube,0
Højlund looks a great player for the future. If only the others had his desire and commitment.,youtube,0
It’s time for Ten Hag to go he’s clearly a fraud we should sound out Phil Parkinson at Wrexham. He knows how to win.,youtube,1
Most entitled fanbase of all time. Where's that chest now?,youtube,0
Galatasaray the best team as always 🦁🏆,youtube,0
Manchester United are yesterdays football club.,youtube,0
De Gea is on the beach somewhere whilst these bums continue to earn a living.,youtube,1
Is Onana allergic to staying on his line smh,youtube,0
Man utd is the provider day in n day out .,youtube,0
Man Utd going from strength to strength building the worst defence in the Premier league. Maguire and 'Oh no i've let another one in' must have some right giggles in training about how piss poor they are.,youtube,1
And De Gea wasn't good enough. Apparently. Onana is shockingly awful.,youtube,0
manures 😮😮😮😮,youtube,0
The amount of money we've wasted on bang average player after bang average player is just scandalous. It's got be some kind of covert money laundering scheme. Hojlund looks like a decent signing for the future I guess. The only one of Ten Hag's purchases that gives me any confidence.,youtube,0
Keeper let more goals in start of this season than dea gea let in all year,youtube,0
Why do all man u/f fans have Cockney accents?14>1 Amen.,youtube,0
‘Stunned united’ it was expected as every game for Utd,youtube,0
onana is pure caca 😂,youtube,1
Onana lol,youtube,0
Rashford is terrible nowhere near the level of Ollie Watkins yet gets the call up by Southgate every year. Not consistent decision making is poor.,youtube,0
What is up with stewards in every Galatasary celebration I see more of them than the players,youtube,0
Been saying it for years and no racsim intended at all.... never buy black goalkeepers.,youtube,1
Listen united are back eras come to an end for klopp and pep it's all about ethHim and Onana are behind the wheel  and will steer us clear of relegation 😂,youtube,0
Can we please get Neil Warnock in before it's too late,youtube,0
Galatasaray taking the piss on and off the pitch 😅😅,youtube,1
Three hag out,youtube,0
for 30 years we bean wating for this..best gs,youtube,0

How many times is onana going to get chipped like that,youtube,0
Waiting for Onana to come out and say he let the team down again ahahas,youtube,0
I think Galatasaray fans best Ultras in World. 73.000 was there and all heard is Gala Fans omg,youtube,0
I was at the gamewatchedthen watched highlights maybe 100 timesits unbelievablewe have icardi and zahathey dont😂yürüyedur galatasarayim❤❤,youtube,0
Mount as much of a flop as maguire was. That utd defence is ridiculous lol the midfield is shocking too. Lindelof is a donkey he didnt even mark back on that second goal he was caught sleeping,youtube,1
What a joke of a club😂,youtube,1
Amrabat at LB is not working atall. . Onana still making mistakes. Such a shame when Hojlund is on fire and rashford has decided to start lookinf for team mates. Mount shoeing glimpsesif they coukd sort the back 5 out they would be ok,youtube,0
galatasaray get out the way!,youtube,1
Ohnono,youtube,0
Aint surprised how Manchester United bottled another game and this time from poor defending and goalkeeping 😔😑,youtube,0
Galatasaray 🤝Onana 💀,youtube,0
Galatasaray definitely should be thanking Andre Onana 😂😂😂🤝,youtube,0
Swear theys something wrang with Manchester united this year,youtube,0
We’re officially the biggest fools in Manchester😢,youtube,1
Big up Wilf bet he loved that!,youtube,0
Who is that clown in goal for Utd?,youtube,1
Apparently we are all stunned every time,youtube,0
Hojlund is a Haaland clone. He might never be as good but they’re both physical specimens faster AND stronger than any defenders they’re both very strong mentally direct and they’re natural goalscorers.He’s still a diamond in the rough he’s not that easy on the eye with the ball at his feet but if he realises his potential he will be some player.,youtube,0
Welcome to Besiktas.,youtube,0
Onana isn’t fit to wear the shirt. Would have rather had dean henderson!,youtube,0
Kerem misses lots of chances but the 2nd GS goal was beautiful-I can’t wait to see how Man U handle the pressure from the Turkish fans in The Cauldron of Hell if they can’t take the pressure to win at home light work,youtube,0
What a keeper!!' How much 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,youtube,1
who does Hojlund think he is Bellingham???,youtube,0
The best thing comes out of this game is we’ve managed to get a World Class Strikerall we need now is a World Class team to go around him  😂,youtube,0
who tf is united ‘s new goalkeeper he is absoulute dybolical,youtube,1
it’s safe to say United ain’t gonna qualify,youtube,0
Good job Galatasaray with one penalty missed 😯,youtube,0
embarrassing lost 4-1 at stamford brigde to brendfort this team is falling apart,youtube,0
Won't be missing on Tuchel too much.,youtube,0
What went wrong in this match?,youtube,0
Rudiger celebration tho 🤣,youtube,0
Look at this dude,youtube,0
Not a chelsea fan but Rudiger's goal was so good it counts as 5 goals. So in the end Chelsea win 5-4,youtube,0
Legends come here to see Rudiger's celebration,youtube,0
Rudiger is. The best defender,youtube,0
YES when it's the same with berenfod bot,youtube,0
HAHAHAHAHAHA,youtube,0
England FIFA World Cup,youtube,0

Losing to teams like West Ham Brentford and Arsenal this season has created a lose in hope for winning the 2021-2023 EPL Trophy. Otherwise we could have surely lifted the 2022 Trophy,youtube,0
To see a great of the game almost lose his life on the pitch then come back play so well and score in the Premiership within the year is truly astounding. Bravo Eriksen ❤,youtube,0
Hahahaha,youtube,0
I end he highlight after rudigers goal,youtube,0
Rudiger 😭😭😭,youtube,0
This is a fixed match,youtube,0
That Goal From Rudiger Was So scary that was crazy,youtube,0
I'm no Brentford fan but I think it was great that Brentford beat Chelsea 4 - 1 at Stamford Bridge. Absolute solid gold hahaha,youtube,0
rudigers goal is surely goal of the month or even the year,youtube,0
I am watching this league before Russian give this country nuclear... I hope not... War did it because stupid and racism politicians...,youtube,1
As a Chelsea fan I just have to applaud Eriksen's goal. He has been through a lot and has been remarkable ever since he made his comeback into football. What a guy what a player.,youtube,0
Chelsea players have their heads already in another club I think many will leave the club in the end of the season due to this situation,youtube,0
The Algerian national team was unjustly wronged in the match that brought it together with the Cameroonian team due to the Gambian referee Gassama who was against Algeria and prevented it from participating in the World Cup.  The Algerian people are asking FIFA to reconsider the outcome of the match because the arbitration disasters affected the result.,youtube,0
They scored and go to the manger like they are wining the primer league then they ate 4 😂😂😂😂😂😂 how small they are,youtube,1
As an LFC fan this gives me the same vibes from the Watford3-0Liverpool game a couple seasons ago,youtube,0
There was no passion There was no aggression There was no energy,youtube,0
Chelsea Fans at different timeline:<br>First 3 Games: Racing for EPL title 🤩<br>Half Season: We can still do it 😙<br>February: Top 3 and defending UCL 🥺<br>Now: 😭😭😭,youtube,0
3rd goal from brendford is really good. Same with Rudigers,youtube,0
Replace the goalkeeper because now he has the curse of the pharaohs,youtube,0
The limbs for Brentford’s goals were insane,youtube,0
Without roman abramovic. Chelsea is nothing,youtube,0
Fantastic Goals from Chelsea  Rudiger kick very dangerous,youtube,0
Small club,youtube,1
Wtf is wrong with the defense?,youtube,1
Bye Chelsea,youtube,0
Im here after the Madrid defeat.... and thiago needs to be checked.... he committing himself too much...most of the goals scored he commits himself,youtube,0
If you just play like this Chelsea will be left with the neighboring club🤔😥,youtube,0
I'm frozen 😨😨😨,youtube,0
only thing that lacked in Rudiger's goal: ceremony,youtube,0
I'm only here for Rudiger's goal the rest can miss me.,youtube,0
super play,youtube,0
I just remember what tuchel said  I will build a team and no one will want to play against,youtube,0
It’s a shame that we lost,youtube,0
Bruh the Brentford team decided to score one goal for every year that Rudiger has been trying to net that long shot,youtube,0
Rüdiger best shoot best playerbest long goal,youtube,0
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha,youtube,0
Rudiger’s wonderful goal is offset by his careless assist. Do hope all of teammates can devote 100% concentration in the coming games.,youtube,0
Mendy blunder 😡,youtube,0

A disaster! Brentford deserved,youtube,1
Pls get new rb lb & cmf. Alonslow & loftuscheek out,youtube,1

🤣🤣🤣🤩🤣🤣🤣Rudigaa🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕,youtube,1
needs to set up a team to investigate how do you lose against Brentford at home by 4 goals (not Man City/Liv)! and you are going to play against RM next why even bother playing just take some rest,youtube,0
Eriksen 🤩,youtube,0
NEXT TIME,youtube,0
Very poor quality video,youtube,0
Don't celebrate too soon.,youtube,0
Please we don't like seeing these kind of clips <br>Why not cut out rudigers goal and the celebration then maybe post the brentford goals for those who want to see it?🙄😒,youtube,0
Defending?,youtube,0
Calling it now southgate will start with hernderson int he euros.And put bellingham in goal.Calling it right now.,youtube,0
Yeah can't wait 4 the euros Bellingham on fire 🔥,youtube,0
Unreal. It's not even news anymore - 6 months ago the world would have been going nuts at a performance like this,youtube,0
2nd goal off side.yes yes yes it's a cheat,youtube,0
"""Almost saying sorry with his hands in pray mode""? More like thank f for that?",youtube,0
Bellingham one of the best mids in the world now becoming a complete midfielder,youtube,0

Dare I say it Bellingham giving Zidane vibes! Theres a reason hes wearing number 5,youtube,0
that pass by alaba was class btw to assist bellingham,youtube,0
Petition to just make Jude Bellingham a CF,youtube,0
Surely he must eye international success which is the only way to become a true footballing legend,youtube,0
Do Real actually have any strikers because Bellingham seems to be the only person in the box half the time. ?,youtube,0
I'm glad Rodriguez is scoring aswell since Benzemas departure. <br>champions league winners?,youtube,0
If Real Madrid could be a national team they could world champions,youtube,0
The football iq of Jude Bellinghams assist 😮‍💨,youtube,0
who tf is this joselu trying to be benzema???? and he tried to be ronaldo copying bycicle kicks but failed and landed on his arse,youtube,1
FFS so Bellingham can head the ball as well ??  The boy is something else,youtube,0
Proud he is a Brummie ❤😂,youtube,0
Jude Bellingham proves how he is a Real Madrid signing once again if he was around 15-20 years ago he would be a galactico no problem,youtube,0
That pass on the last goal 👌🏽,youtube,0
Best thing real Madrid did was sign Bellingham wow what a player,youtube,0
Balloon dor lockdown already my guy Bellingham,youtube,0
To go to two different countries with such confidence and so young is unreal,youtube,0
He IS special n I've watched a LOT of football over the years .,youtube,0
People who think Bellingham's gonna be the future goat <br>👇,youtube,1
Osimhen standing so blatantly offside is worrying from a chelsea fans perspective,youtube,0
Real Madrids young players Going crazy nahhh,youtube,0
Everyone posting completely over-the-top praise for Bellingham and it's all 100% deserved. That assist with the outside of the boot in the 93rd min. Yikes.,youtube,0
Keeper should save the one for 3-2 all day Napoli would've probably got a result if he did,youtube,0
What?! No mention that Madrid’s 3rd goal was a goalkeeping mistake?! If that was Onana….,youtube,0
Ancelottis reaction when Joselu finally scores at the end is pretty amazing what a manager 👏🏾,youtube,0
£100m is looking a right bargain.  Bellingham just does everything.,youtube,0
Great stuff from Bellingham but he’s just started. Let’s not get carried away I see people in the comments comparing him to Pele 😂. Relax guys. He has to do it season in season out for a long period of time. Right now let’s just enjoy his football and not state outlandish stuff.,youtube,0
I always thought Bellingham was overhyped and Madrid made the wrong choice in buying him but boy was I wrong dude is smart and gifted! What a performance and player! Wait till they buy Mbappe :O,youtube,0
Jude had an excellent game but why were all the other Real Madrid strikers trying to do a Garnacho overhead kick,youtube,0
Why everyone tryna recreate the goal,youtube,0
Jude Bellingham is doin up New Star Soccer in real life 😂It’s too easy for him,youtube,0
Madrid the REAL deal.,youtube,0
I don't know any English player that's reached at heights playing for a foreign team at such a young age the world is oyster this could be one of the greatest English players of all time Bellingham 👍,youtube,0
Legendary night at the Santiago Bernabeu,youtube,0
What a player Jude is,youtube,0
Unpopular opinion... I think Rodrygo is better on the left than Vini is,youtube,0
Joselu 😑😑😑,youtube,0
Immense player.,youtube,0
Jonathan Pearce so slow on the commentary he is a play by play commentator ...he needs to build excitement....can TNT give him some honest feedback please?,youtube,0
Nico pas .. what a strike from him 👏,youtube,0
Alaba learnt very well from modric,youtube,0
I mean....how good is Bellingham?? Crazy watching him last night. Touch is class can finish can pass.  Goal and assist created plenty and never stopped running.  What a unit.,youtube,0
Bellingham's last assist unreal!,youtube,0
Jude is getting at least 30 goals this season with the way he’s been playing! Hopefully he keeps fit. Best player in the world rn plays effortlessly.,youtube,0
Title should be jude helps inspire but cause he's English jude inspires  even though rodrygo got first goal,youtube,0
What a ball for the fourth goal surprised the commentators didn’t make a bigger noise.,youtube,0
Jude is reminding of Owen when he was 18/20 and he was killing it at liverpool...if jude stays fit all season he is going set even more levels than he has already,youtube,0
joselu is the darwin of la liga,youtube,0
That was poor from alaba he should of know better my man was day dreaming lol,youtube,0
What boots was Bellingham wearing? 👁 👁,youtube,0
Sad not to see Modrić involved,youtube,0
Questions about Real defensively.,youtube,0
Everyone is talking about Bellingham and I know he is insane right now but I feel we need to give Rodrygo some respect. He is playing brilliantly filling in for vini and I think he could go on to score a ton more goals by the end of the season👏👏👏,youtube,0
Rodrygo is a monster.,youtube,0
Should have shown Bellingham in midfield before the last goal. Not only did he get the assist but he started the whole move!,youtube,0
When bellingham scored it made the score 1-1 it was meant to be 2-0,youtube,0
I wish Bellingham played for Newcastle 😞,youtube,0
Bellingham ... english machine !,youtube,0
If RM had better forwards Belllingham would have had four assists in this match. What really stood out for me was Bellingham's run for his goal. He was unmarked because of his vision to run into the space for the cross. This is his 'footballing intelligence' which is the key to his goalscoring success.,youtube,0
If Jude keeps going at this rate and Real win the champions league the Ballon d’or will have his name on it 🫡,youtube,0
Jude is playing well for real Madrid but let's not go all topsy turvy about him too soon.,youtube,0
I liked it when everyone tried topping Garnacho with failed overheads 😂,youtube,0
Hey Jude. ♥️🇬🇧,youtube,0
the amount of bicycle kicks everybody’s trying since Garnacho is hilarious 😂,youtube,0
nice to see ferland mendy play. 💯💪🏿,youtube,0
Where is kepa,youtube,0
Rodrygo gone up a level recently…I’m impressed. And Bellingham is just well Bellingham.,youtube,0
Bellingham and Kane showing English players can be amazing abroad,youtube,0
Let’s make everything about Bellingham because he’s English 😂 if he was Brazilian no one would’ve heard his hame,youtube,0
True story with Jude Bellingham. What a journey……and it’s only just started,youtube,0
best player in the world at the moment,youtube,0
That no.99 for napoli looks like a fifa pro clubs player. No. 21 for Real Madrid looks promising. Brilliant talent on ball,youtube,0
Jude is the definition of world class. Generational baller,youtube,0
What a comeback 👏,youtube,0
did not show the final post from Inter,youtube,0
Man alive that curse isn’t going anywhere,youtube,0
Why is number 19 not mentioned ONCE by the commentator and Mario was congratulated numerous times when he just finished what no19 started off with hard work for EVERY goal?,youtube,0
No penalty ref is poor,youtube,0
Another bad decision for the red card here.,youtube,0
At the end inter was taking over,youtube,0
That red card was so strange. To me its clear yellow card. Yes its late and aggresive but come on this is football not softball.,youtube,0
I know Utd blundered a 2 goal lead but a 3 goal lead 😂 That's absolutely shocking 😂😂😂,youtube,1
Didn't the flag go up on the first goal or am I been dumb?,youtube,1
How did inter end up with Sanchez and mkhitaryan 😂🤷🏾‍♂️ both ex Arsenal & Man Utd players part of the swap deal,youtube,0
No Grimaldo no party.....,youtube,0
That must be the ugliest  hat-trick ever...three mis-hits three goals,youtube,0
Lol Sporting youth player carry Benfica.,youtube,0
That's never a red. Soft as butter that is.,youtube,1
Has everyone forgotten Inter was starting 8 of their subs in this game? Immediate impact from Thuram in the second half. And even Lautaro has just played the final 10 minutes of the game. They would have won it if Barella's strike hadn't hit the post. That's differences between these two teams both mentality and ability.,youtube,0
Joao mario 3 goals at 33 minutes,youtube,0
That penalty is absolutely hilarious. Football is becoming a joke,youtube,0
Dogshit decision for the penalty should have been a yellow for simulation fcking embarrassing.,youtube,1
Today is when I found out that Arnautovic and Sanchez played for Inter,youtube,0
More tactical from serie a legs go longer run wen needed,youtube,0
How on earth is that a red? There's gonna be 5 reds a game if this is the standard being set for the future,youtube,0
hmm... not a penalty and not a red,youtube,0
Commentators like pro evo 5 lol,youtube,0
What they dont show in this video is the foul on Neves before the Pen was given,youtube,0
Christ almighty! Never a penalty or a sending off🤦‍♂️!??? The Officials are doing this on purpose for all the years of abuse! -  It's the only explanation surely🤔🤷‍♂️!,youtube,1
Happy for Sanchez didn’t work at that dead club Man Utd but no one has thrived their last 6 years anyway. Sanchez was INCREDIBLE at Arsenal will always have love for him 🙏,youtube,0
Never a pen,youtube,0
😂😂😂 love to see it 😂😂<br>Poor Portuguese 😢,youtube,1
Officiating standards in football these days are absolutely abysmal.Most ridiculous things as the lino flagging for offside when he was clearly unsighted by the player stood in front!They’re all just guessing now.,youtube,0
I thought Sanchez scored or something,youtube,0
Has to be the scrapiest worst hat trick iv ever seen,youtube,1
Poor refereeing.,youtube,1
I swear every season joao Mario has 1 performance like this,youtube,0
That red card is outrageous- game’s gone,youtube,0
Never seen a player so sure he was onside,youtube,0
The linesman raises the flag for every goal it's a joke😂😂,youtube,0
BENFICA 🦅was robbed of a victory 😏,youtube,0
Football as we know it  is fini,youtube,0
Alexis sanchez should not have gone to utd that was a big mistake considering he could have been one of the top players itw in his prime,youtube,0
No chance that was a penalty cmon WTF haha,youtube,1
This is why Inter and City were the UCL finalist last season. Just different mentality. Mentality decided everything.,youtube,0
Alexis looks skinny now. He was really bulked back then,youtube,0
Beşiktaş : 3 Benfica :3  🖤🤍,youtube,0
What a game,youtube,0
How was that a penalty for Thuram? 😂😂😂,youtube,0
haven't heard worse commentary in a while absolutely dire and lifeless,youtube,0
No highlight of barella shot on the post??,youtube,0
Benfica once again were robed against INTER even with Var referees can manipulate games! the mistakes cannot benefit always the same team! Some of this champions league games should be investigated by the police!!!,youtube,0
How is that a flipping red what is going on with the game this season???  Saying its lost it way is an understatement! Lawmakers need to have serious re-think otherwise fans and players just getting p1ssed off all the time every game. Not enjoyable anymore,youtube,0
Wow I thought we had a bad night with Galatasaray,youtube,0
Considering Inzaghi rested a lot of the first team its a good performance,youtube,0
"Italian sport journalists before this weeks games: ""It is good that Mats Hummels is playing against Milan. Right now Acerbi is better than Hummels""Hummels: Hold my beerAcerbi: Hold my Spritz",youtube,0
I can't believe alexis sanchez is still playing seems like about 20yr ago he was failing miserably at united lmfao he must be about 40 lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂,youtube,0
Soft as pen,youtube,0
Benfica 🤝Man United 🤝 Sevilla            Bottlejobs             FC,youtube,0
Never a penalty and never a red card. Benfica have been cheated by the officials here,youtube,0
Benfica rlly bottled a 3 goal lead inter are cheats tho and that was never a red benfica player got the ball var and refs are trash nowadays...,youtube,1
If only Alexis didn’t go Manchester united,youtube,0
Love it when benfica drop points,youtube,0
Where is the fault highlight on the other side before the 3rd goal?,youtube,0
So VAR sent him to the monitor for the red card tackle but not the penalty where he clearly got the ball? Amazing. Just amazing.,youtube,0
Barella hits the crossbar at extra time but because this is an English Tv they will not show in highlights 😠,youtube,0
Crazy game crazy Inter we don't play easy games never that's why we love our outstanding nerazzurri team finally Marko and Alexis scored for Inter if we'd started better in the first half maybe the outcome would've been different but that's alright Sunday's game is more important than last night one always and only Forza Inter forever 🖤 💙 G,youtube,0
So many referees commenting on the penalty. Wonder why they’re not in the job.,youtube,0
Had a good laugh at that red card it was an obvious yellow what has the game come to 😂,youtube,0
No way thats a pen!,youtube,0
Inter fired its engines in the second half and even a second team were over Benfica!.,youtube,0
Joao Mario scored a hattrick in 33 minutes against his former club. Brilliant,youtube,0
Plays the ball and var thinks it’s a penalty yellow card tackle then the same referees checking the monitor decide that it’s a red .Uefa and Fifa might want them for the next Major competitions  the level of refereeing have gone down since  World Cup 2014.Most of the “best” referees are at 2nd division level  just look at the past two World Cups.,youtube,0
Commentary : “ he scored against is own club “I mean Joao Mario was sold it’s not his club. And they kept saying the same 😂That red card and penalty were a disgrace. Completely wrong. Also seen people commenting that everyone is against Benfica in this season well I don’t think so unfortunately for Benfica was unfair that penalty completely wrong but the rest of the CL games it’s on them they just couldn’t play good. So no one is against Benfica it’s their own fault.,youtube,0
The Rangers* will have to rely on that 8 goal winning margin for Barça after all.,youtube,0
Sanchez Arsenal reunion?😉,youtube,0
2 days in a row matches have been rigged by penalties. CL is finished.,youtube,0
Sachez playing must be old video😄,youtube,0
Defo a red card late over the ball and out of control.,youtube,0
We gave benfica hope by not starting regular players then took it away 😂 Forza Inter 🖤💙,youtube,0
Never a red card 👎,youtube,0
13 years between goals got to be a record?,youtube,0
Very soft penalty. Hate to see these given,youtube,0
Crazy that VAR was brought in to overrule terrible decisions like the penalty and the red card yet now it’s actually having the opposite effect. What a shambles 🤦‍♂️,youtube,0
Never a penalty never a red card. The CL Gods are against Benfica this season,youtube,0
Wait is the guy from F2 working for benfica now?,youtube,0
Unbelievable penalty given. How on earth did this ref give that,youtube,0
Red card was harsh. But more importantly penalty should not be given. He clearly takes the ball. Benfica robbed off their first win. NEUTRAL GALATASARAY FAN HERE :),youtube,0
I don't understand this game anymore. That is not a red card also the pen was not a pen. But well VAR coming on to ruin the game,youtube,0
Pen was soft & that was not a red .,youtube,0
Istanbul 2005 Bollywood edition,youtube,0
There were 2 clear referee mistakes.The penalty is not a penalty as the Benfica defender quicks the ball and is Inter striker that goes against the legs of the Benfica defender as he could not stop running. The direct sent off of the Benfica defender is too severe as a yellow card should be the right decision.There was no aggression from the Benfica defender as he just wanted to play the ball.Very bad referring and when is on a champions league game it is total unacceptable. Benfica was robbed of a clear victory. 😮,youtube,0
Two strikers nearing 35 and one of thems Arnautović. inter are getting knocked out next stage for sure.,youtube,0
How on earth is that a penalty?,youtube,0
That was never a penalty or a red card,youtube,0
Another interesting game tonight not a red though,youtube,0
Amazing comeback but that was not a penalty nor a red card.Two stupid decisions as usual 😮,youtube,1
Moronic decision for the red card.,youtube,1
What a game,youtube,0
he was the problem,youtube,0
But Ronaldo was the problem …..,youtube,0
Harry maguire’s boots made him good,youtube,0
This Man Utd was better than what we are seeing now  Ten hag is killing the team 😢,youtube,0
And people say he was the problem.,youtube,0
Can’t believe last year we were watching Cr7 do this for United 😂☕️,youtube,0
Ronnie was right,youtube,0
The day Ronaldo saved Maguire,youtube,0
I know he ended not on the best terms but... i am proud to say i took my dad to his first Old Trafford game and he saw Cristiano Ronaldo score a hat trick. one of my fondest memories i'll cherish forever with my dad ❤,youtube,0
I cried that day what a legend 🥹,youtube,0
Show me Messi scoring HatTrick in PL against top team at this age…I will call him goat myself 🤫🤭,youtube,0
The greatest of all time,youtube,0
United should have built around Ronaldo instead of letting Eric Ten Hag bin him.,youtube,0
This is my premier league game of all time. Masterclass from Ronaldo Old Trafford buzzing drama tension it had everything!,youtube,0
Best player I've ever seen and to do it for all those years in so many different leagues!  beautiful footballer,youtube,0
Can we give City Maguire for free?,youtube,0
What a mistake to let Ronaldo go. he has done so much for Manchester United. The way he was treated by fans   the Clubs and the U.K. media was disgraceful.,youtube,0
Ten fraud,youtube,1
ranoldo scord. the. goal,youtube,0

As much as Maguire annoys us all with his OG we need to have some respect towards him ❤,youtube,0
The No.7❤,youtube,0
So much respect when Man United re-signed Ronaldo and so much disrespect when he left... Long live the king,youtube,0
Whos here after we lost 2-0 to spurs ronaldo clearly was never the problem single handedly destroyed spurs all by himself with a hatrick and yet this team eth is building cant even score 1 goal as a team 😴,youtube,0
Who else came bck for this reminder since they got 2-0 from Tottenham 2023,youtube,0
proves without a real striker  most of the time you wont win  atleast ronaldo clutched that time but we dint even have proper striker playing,youtube,0
Who's here after Spus battered United 2-0?,youtube,0
"and he was the ""problem"" - Media",youtube,0
ronaldo the GOAT ALWAYS MESSI IS RUBBISH,youtube,1
I got to watch him play so I don’t care what  nobody says my eyes don’t lie this guy is an animal 🦁 🐅 🎯,youtube,1
His third goal is biblical.,youtube,0
We will surely miss Ronaldo at Man U 😩,youtube,0
Harry maguire is so bab,youtube,1

Ronoldo had enough and just headed it !what a hatrick,youtube,0
what a finish messi never do that,youtube,0
is this when Cristiano Ronaldo did a 119km an hour shot,youtube,0
Pomero deserved that humbling for screaming at Maguires face,youtube,1
I know it didn’t last long his 2nd spell but moments like this one made it worth him being back for a little bit,youtube,0
Some of us will never forget how great he is. Sometimes a player and team just no longer fit.,youtube,0
Maguire owngoaled,youtube,0
The people in this stadium witnessed an absolutely spectacular ronaldo performance this was the Ronaldo show at the theatre of dreams,youtube,0
So close de hea penalty,youtube,0
what a goal from Ronaldo,youtube,0
Harry Maguire 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐,youtube,1
Can someone tell me how a 'washed up' player scored a hat trick? Why did they get rid of him?,youtube,1
Bro wtf with the people hating on Ronaldo bc of him going to another league like just have a look this man was class 10-9 month ago and oc still. Can't blame him just glad we have the opportunity to watched it live.,youtube,1
they did him dirty,youtube,0
He single-handedly saved them numerous times from the champions league games on their group that season and got them to the knockout stages of the champions league and not to mention helping them finish in a Europa league spot. Without him they would’ve finished mid table in the league and crashed out of group stage too. In my opinion he deserves a statue outside Old Trafford he really is the GOAT and the way how the club and the fans have disrespected him and turned on him is criminal,youtube,0
People forget how much he did on his return. Utd fans are disgraceful,youtube,0
How quickly people forget...,youtube,0
I don’t see how in less than a season they stopped trusting a GOAT,youtube,0
And now he is hated. Shows what stories and fickle human brains can do. Legend irrespective.,youtube,0
sorry but Ronaldo was bigger than the club at this point. united totally disrespected him. his last moments at united were sabotaged.,youtube,0
miss u Ronaldo U r forever star of Manchester United,youtube,0
utd actually ruined this man,youtube,0
60 hat tricks Legend,youtube,0
Does a player really go from scoring 18 League goals in a season to nothing? The amount of disrespect this man has gotten is crazy. There will never be another Ronaldo 😔,youtube,0
What a goal amazing we love ronaldo 7,youtube,0
i refuse to belive that THIS is gone just like that. no way. He needs to do a proper farewell season. too much personal tragedie and dramas.,youtube,0
Sui boy got 99 over all,youtube,0
Then ten hag comes in and stopped all that momentum 😞,youtube,0
CAN HE JUST COME BACK AGAIJ ALREADY 😢🥺,youtube,0
Ronaldo is legend ❤,youtube,0
Ronaldo is the goat and always will be stupid united fans have forgotten what he has done for the club,youtube,1
A legend be will long remain!,youtube,0
As a Real Madrid fan it’s a shame how Manchester United has treated this legend.,youtube,0
Well done Copenhagen !,youtube,0
That red card is an absolute disgrace never is that a sending off. What has football become,youtube,0
Love Copenhagen ❤️✌️👏👏,youtube,0
👍,youtube,0
Fair play Copenhagen I doubt many people predicted they'd get to the knockouts,youtube,0
As a gala fan  respect to Copenhagen well deserved,youtube,0
It's great to see the underdogs make it to the knockout stages a shame this time it wasn't to be for Manchester United and Copenhagen made it through,youtube,0
As a Galatasaray fan I would like to congratulate Copenhagen. They played very well and their fans were crazy and they even managed to go ahead of Man U AND us. Fair play 👏👏👏👏👏,youtube,0
Rakow Czestochowa from Poland was more challenging rival for FC Copenhagen than Man.UTD what a story what a crazy results of real football not from media circus market.,youtube,0
That white wall of support 😮 true dedication to the club!,youtube,0
Yanited 🤣🤣🤣,youtube,1
As a United fan am happpy galatasray went to Europe 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉,youtube,0
What a great achievement for Copenhagen Football Club. I don’t think anyone thought they’d win a single game in the beginning and they ended up qualifying,youtube,0
WOW Gala are such a small team nowadays.,youtube,1
Congratulations to Copenhagen they fully deserved their win 👏👏,youtube,0
don’t know what will be crazier this or newcastle if we go through,youtube,0
Ngl when this group came out I thought Bayern and Utd will make the knockouts and Galatasaray Europa. But great achievement by Copenhagen to make the UCL knockout stages.,youtube,0
As  longest Turks did not go through,youtube,1
Copenhagen fans doing Skyrim dragons shouts as chants 🤣,youtube,0
Glory  Glory  Man Utd As The Reds Go Marching OUT....,youtube,0
As a Galatasaray fan I could say that Copenhagen fully deserved to win the game absolutely well played,youtube,0
People will talk about how bad United were in this group and rightly so but the fact Copenhagen managed to finish ahead of Galatasaray and United and reach the knockouts is an incredible story.,youtube,0
LETS LAUGH AT MANCHESTER UNITED🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,youtube,1
Galatasaray might be out of the Champions League but at least they'll have Europa League in the new year unlike a certain team from Manchester.,youtube,0
Needed galatasary to score for £870 😡,youtube,0
Bet they'll get Man City in the Round of 16.,youtube,0
Yesss Copenhagen- What a tough team to beat. As a Liverpool fan i'm so happy😊,youtube,0
Well deserved ! They showed a lot of fight unlike the team that finished 4th 😅,youtube,0
for Copenhagen to get second in this group is massive players played their hearts out,youtube,0
Copenhagen's resilience and togetherness remind me of Denmark's Euro 2020 run,youtube,0
Fair play🤝🏼Definitely more deserving to qualify than the joke team man united,youtube,0
Lets all laugh at Yanited! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,youtube,0
Bloody hell forgot about Elneny!!,youtube,0
Some fans on here saying Arsenals second should have counted Gabi interfered with play as much as I would like the automated offside to be shown it’s offside,youtube,0
We REALLY need Cms.,youtube,0
Bakayoko is some player man would mind signing him as back up to Saka or to push him,youtube,0
Not sure why Gabriel is given offside when the only person he interferes with is Kiwor 🫠,youtube,0
"""ramsdale was beaten"" he just saved  it off the damn post",youtube,0
Finding ways to disallow goals again,youtube,0
Saliba and gabriel today 🔥,youtube,0
‘Eddie Nketiah instinctive. That’s what he was all about.’ Joey Barton was right.,youtube,0
Very poor defending from saliba,youtube,0
Well done PSV for getting the equaliser.,youtube,0
We should of played better and won and Eddie and Nelson and Cedric and more needs to be sold in January,youtube,0
ramsdale was beaten ? he saved it dimwit😂,youtube,1
This clown got beaten twice by Unia Emery with two different teams,youtube,1
Bring back ramsdale,youtube,0
Why was kiwor goal disallowed💀💀💀,youtube,1
The header wasnt offside Gabriel didnt touch the ball,youtube,0
TH14 goal from psv 😮,youtube,0
Ramsdale IN 🫡🙌🏼,youtube,0
Not gonna lie Ramsdale is shocking 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,youtube,0
I dont know what it is with trossard sometimes he looks like he doesnt want to be there and loses the ball or does a bad pass,youtube,0
If only he did pass that ball to No 14 that would have been another story. Egoistic,youtube,0
Elneny only scores bangers 😂 if that shot off the post had gone in it would've been another to add to the collection,youtube,0
The save was so good the commentator had to say he was beaten. He couldn't believe it because it's not often keepers make world class reactions like that.,youtube,0
Nonsense match just t complete group  with many debutants; I'll take the draw an move onto Brighton,youtube,0
Haven’t seen an Arsenal keeper make a save like Ramsdale’s since… Ramsdale. Raya never ever saves anything he shouldn’t the goal at Villa was right at him just needed to stand tall but Allison won Liverpool 2 points at Palace put them top and that’s why we will lose the competitions we’re in this season because Arteta won’t see he’s wrong until it’s too late,youtube,0
pepi and tillman usa players running rings around ENGCLOWN PREM PLAYERS,youtube,0
Kiwiors goal should have stood in my opinion,youtube,0
Confused why Kiwior goal disallowed he was clearly onside and keeper just completely misjudged his punch. Didn't interfere with him at all ball was already clearly past keeper before he was even close to Gabriel...,youtube,0
Okay it doesn’t really matter whether they win or lose they have overwhelmingly qualified for the next round. I suppose they have to go through the process that might influence who could possibly qualify with them. Not that it matters for Arsenal fans.,youtube,0
Ramsdale got the slightest of touches and goal should have stood,youtube,0
Finish by Eddie 👏🏿👏🏿,youtube,0
Glad ramsdale finally made a well deserved champions league appearance. He is one of the reasons we are in the competition and his treatment over Raya has been awful by arteta. I wish Eddie scored in games when it matters as he has been pretty absent for some time now needs to prove why we don’t need to seek a striker in the transfer window,youtube,0
Trossard is a criminal but squaring to Nketiah. Same as Nketiahs crime a few weeks back.,youtube,1
So disagree with the comment below this !,youtube,0
I’m not sure how Arsenal’s second goal was an offside. I think that was Kiwior’s goal. And he was on,youtube,0
Ramsdale is a better keeper than Raya.,youtube,0
Where ramsdale save,youtube,0
elneny is actually amazing at long shots. so unlucky to hit the post.,youtube,0
Arsenal are falling apart already 😂,youtube,0
Playing saliba and Gabriel come on bruv give them a rest knowing we’re topping the group regardless of todays result and the fact that we’ve got a couple of big games coming up too,youtube,0
Well done Kiwior,youtube,0
That should of been a full 11 rested right before the busy Xmas period would of made sense the game was a dead game would of made more sense to give game time to all the fringe/ young academy players knocking on the 1st team’s locker room,youtube,0
👍🏻,youtube,0
they got unlucky,youtube,0
Trossard getting greedy. 2 chances to pass to Nketiah for an easy finish. Could have been 3-1.,youtube,0
Trossard really isn’t in form at the moment!😢,youtube,0
I think the selection and the subs used in this game were needless from Arteta. I’ve no idea why he’s against playing the youngsters in a game like this. I genuinely believe that if Saka was in the U-21’s when Arteta joined us he’d be nowhere near as established as he is now,youtube,0
As a Chelsea fanim really scared now arsenal could win the champions league 😢,youtube,0
Kiwior destroyed 😂😂 good game tho,youtube,0
Eddie is still garbage,youtube,1
Ramsdale proving why he should be number 1. No idea what Arteta sees in Raya,youtube,0
Why did Gabriel hold off so much for there goal he should of gone across and closed down the defender school boy defending,youtube,0
Where is Nwaneri all now? Arteta really is allergic to youth development 🤒,youtube,0
‘Ramsdale was beaten’ - it was an incredible reaction save onto the post! The Ramsdale hate continues,youtube,0
I don't know why Arteta isn't being praised for not being dog sh*t bad in the group stage like Manchester United & Newcastle United 🤣🤣😘😘,youtube,1
The woodwork saw more action that game than I do most years!,youtube,0
should’ve played at least ONE academy player. has Arteta given any a chance in his career?,youtube,0
Happy with a draw won the group hopefully no injuries to key players,youtube,0
Players who do the Shhh celebration end up losing or drawing the game. No arsenal player should be doing that celebration.,youtube,0
Happy Ramsdale got his debut finally and Eddie scored his first Champion's league goal. Was also pretty impressed by Nelson Arteta has got to give him more of a chance in the league.,youtube,0
Reiss Nelson should be trusted more by Arteta. Great finish from Eddie. Lord please help Smith Rowe to stay injury free. Amen.,youtube,0
Reiss nelson MOTM. Deserves more gametime.,youtube,0
WILLIAM SALIBABA!!! What a tackle.,youtube,0
i watched the match and ramsdale and elneny performed rlly well hope they get some more mins,youtube,0
Elneny still being at Arsenal is mid-boggling. Only the player still left from the Wenger days,youtube,0
Rambo was better tonight,youtube,0
Good result for our B team,youtube,0
Lovely from psv to qualify for the ro16,youtube,0
Hopefully now Arsenal can whinge about something in this game rather than being beaten by Villa.,youtube,0
Bakayoko what a talent 🔥,youtube,0
After a very long time was not bothered about a result in Europe 🤣🤣🤣,youtube,0
Player who headed Arsenal’s 2nd wasn’t offside!  What’s going on here?,youtube,0
Arsenal in europe is pure banter,youtube,0
Even the 2nd choice team miss chances get practicing boys!,youtube,0
trossard should have passed to eddie score would be 2-1 smh,youtube,0
Arsenal will not win the ucl. Imagine not getting 18 points in a mickey mouse group 😂😂😂,youtube,0
This jus proves nd shows our Squad depth  is really poor,youtube,0
1 hour gang,youtube,0
Don’t know why Arteta isn’t playing some of the academy players in this game. It means nothing,youtube,0
Arsenal happy that they've avoided Bayern in the knockout last 16 😂,youtube,0
W group stage for Arsenal COYG,youtube,0
That Bakayoko looks a player. Ripped us tonight,youtube,0
Glad we are though to the Round of 16 hopefully we can reach far in the ucl COYG,youtube,0
Dybala should have passed the ball to lukaku,youtube,0
Lukaku made a scar King tackle,youtube,0
It‘s insane how everyone talks about Lukaku‘s foul but no one cares about the horrible tackle by Kayode on Zalewsky. Clear red card. Ridiculous refereeing once again.,youtube,0
How on earth does El Sharawry still get minutes. Absolute fraud of a footballer.,youtube,1
1st goal offside???,youtube,0
If we see the Lukaku's tackle we understand because fowars score goals and centre-backs defend. Each player have a position.,youtube,0
Lukaku is crazy you can see the rip from the players socks when he came in with studs! Imagine it was planted? That would’ve been game over for him,youtube,0
Fiorentina Roma 7-1 🤣,youtube,0
Lukaku did the same fault if not worse last year vs Juventus in semi-final's Copa Italia. It was not even call as fault. Things are different when you wear Inter shirt,youtube,0
That Mourinho handshake was the total opposite of the Tuchel one with Conte last season at Stamford Bridge but with the same degree of anger.,youtube,0
No fair game  everytime they have foul on  Dybala referee doesn't even show the yellow card  here straight red . Insane .,youtube,0
lakaka idiot,youtube,1
Lukaku is clearly offside for the 1st goal😂😂,youtube,0
Mourinho shows his class tactics when a player gets sent off. Credit is due were its due.,youtube,0

Lukaku tackle was just insane😢,youtube,0
That tackle even ripped the socks imagine if he got the leg he almost ended the guy’s career,youtube,0
Why all the hate for Lukaku ? I think it's the second red card in all his career.... Of course the tackle was horrible but I've seen worse.,youtube,0
Vamooooos Roma❤,youtube,0
That mourinho look says it all 😂😂,youtube,0
that one-touch pass from Cristante for the first goal was fire,youtube,0
Lukaku is saving roma,youtube,0
I'm going to make a documentary about that commentators accent,youtube,0
2 red card 1-1 amazing as roma. No bad,youtube,0
That was a red card every day of the week. Lukaku knows better.,youtube,0
Well it was fun to watch while it lasted but now Dybala is injured and thus ends Roma's little winning streak.,youtube,0
Dybala is ghosted forever.,youtube,0
Forza Bologna,youtube,0
Not the Mour approach. Roma fortunate to get a point n  should have known better impact of losing one player in the game moreover two where they won at Sassulo last week playing against 10 men.,youtube,0
That tackle was so unneccessary,youtube,0
Note always bet over 3.5 for cards in this game 😂,youtube,0
roma without dybala are horrible,youtube,0
Lukaku should get a 10 match suspension for that disgusting.,youtube,0
Lukaku like amator player,youtube,0
Lukaku why ??,youtube,0
What a shameful team as roma is. They should get 7 red cards every single match. Awful defensive football constant complaining about referees… a disgusting team.,youtube,1

PSG fans  I have some good news for you . Last night I dreamed of Paris Saint Germain winning the Champions League final 3-0 against Real Madrid with a hat-trick from my boy Mbappe . There is a high chance that it was a premonitory dream knowing that I had already dreamed of our defeat in the final against Bayern in 2020 before the match . I can assure you that my comment will become historic and will go around all the football pages in a few months after my premonitory dream will come true  ICI C'EST PARIS ❤️ 💙,youtube,0
Lets see if PSG can beat Dortmund on wednesday,youtube,0

England's biggest downfall will be same as always a midfield incapable of controlling an dictating a game. Henderson Dier is one of the weakest midfield pairings England have had since probably Graham Taylor. England have pace an will prob score goals but they want have a midfield to take the steam out the game when Infront or give them some respite from running around like headless chickens,youtube,0

England are no longer england it is a team of Africans with British passports.,youtube,1
They should give all African players a one time option to opt out of their European national team play for their homeland. Majority came under duress and manipulation by their desperate parents (can’t blame them). Majority fled from war and poverty. If they could I bet they would opt out . They get abuse like sterling is all the time. Look at balotelli. They are not appreciated in Europe.,youtube,0

Before watching the game I was proud of South Africa that they beat Morocco by 2-1 but after watching this highlights they only won by the mistakes done by the opposition But a win is a win,youtube,0
South Africa always beats morocco its like a complex!,youtube,0
Africa football is getting better we could win the world cup,youtube,0
I do not want to see the key players were absent  and the coach was trying new tactics and played many players out of their regular position  the main cause is fatigue  playing in south africa  end of season fatigue Combined with a previous match versus cap vert just two days before this match take into account the long travel and training session the game was just like a training session for the players and the coach tested new faces  but they failed  morocco is going to win the CAN Africa Inchallah  the only rival team is Senegal we scored an own goal  Bono did not play  amrabat ounahi boufal  khannouss abde Harit  Adli the star in germany  etc,youtube,0

Congratulations south africa was the best in this game 🇿🇦❤️🇲🇦,youtube,0
Both Goals were goalkeeper's fault,youtube,0
morocco already qualified and trying to put the C players for the first time in the team it's normal to loose such kind of matches. for example against cap vert the middle was replaced 2/3 and in this match 3/3 totaly an other team with new goalkeeper and attack.<br>congratulation to south africa but this is no the team who faced brazil spain or portugal. you may desagree but it's the reality,youtube,0
a win is a win congrats to south Africa from morocco  it's like when morocco win against brazil not all players were present but a win is a win,youtube,0

Football History lessons : South African players won the Uefa championship before Bono won the Europa... SA players captained EPL teams before any Moroccan player can player in the EPL.... Our league is the best in Afrika in every aspect....if you play in the PSL  it's the same as playing in Belgium... Holland...so going abroad is not high up in our list... Siyawuthanda unobhutshuzwayo The only soccer stadium that is bigger than our Calabash is Spotify nou camp in the whole world and the Old Maracana... We have a derby that host a bigger capacity than anything that Wimbledon has ever seen.....Our soccer fraternity is built to celebrate the greatness of anyone who represents the continent at his best... In the 90's the! Nigerian team of Sunday Oliseh we knew the whole line up of the Eagles.... Early 2000 we were taken by Cameroon of Mboma and eto.. Two. Most popular Egyptian footballers in South Africa are hosam Hassan and the greatest North African player Mohammed Aboutrika...during the Caf games we always want Raja and Waydad to be present they are doing something great for the continental soccer.... Add and correct.... See you in In Ivory Coast,youtube,0
Morroco has a great coach your achievements at past world cup bring us(Caf) closer to the final  to the rest of the continent the race is who gets to the final.... Then next finishing line is who will be the first one to win the world cup.,youtube,0

Algerians are the morons of Africa hands down. They are happy more than south africans because we lost a meaningless game where our coach tried new players and tactics. We reached the semifinal of the world cup and we are number 11 in FIFA ranking and we are going to beat all the teams in the two coming AFCON and win at least one of them before making again history in 2026. Meanwhile south Africa hasn't yet qualified to a world cup though it played once as host and got humiliated,youtube,1

To blame the keeper for coming out is fair it's clearly a mistake but to say that that shot is a clear and easy save is pure delusion look at the speed of the header without slow motion and also the placement right below the bar that's still a very hard save to be made even if the keeper was perfectly positioned,youtube,0
and that’s how Ronaldo maintains his 100% win rate in World Cup finals,youtube,0

"The fact that there is not a singlegerman defender in Bayern’s starting lineup speaks volumes. Gone are the days of Boa , Lahm and Hummels , Ginter etc keeping it safe and quiet at the back. Bayern need to speed up and intensify development of some home grown defending talents if they don’t want to continue outsourcing expensive transfers from outside the league.As for Dortmund idk wth is up with Sule and Schlotterbeck just standing like two giant easter island dummies .

Literally every player has been tested in all possible formations and tactics. We even tried „the best coaches“ we have. The puzzle just doesn’t solve. We have good players, not as good as one generation before, especially in the Defense which is horrific right now tbh, but midfield and attack has great potential, at least in theory. But it seems they can’t be formed as a working unit. Maybe we have to accept and wait until it gets better. Our gems Musiala and Wirtz still have over a decade left. Plenty of time to form a team around them.",reddit,0

" Cant play with a 3/5 defense when you dont even have the players for it sane and kai dont know the position to play the defensive part whole game with discipline And henrichs is wasted as rcb .When pressed high the offense doesnt drop far enough back and there is a big space between def and offense which forces long high balls and we dont have players who can shield the ball or win a header fülle a little but not nearly enough.Gündogan kimmich pairing is bad because they are both weak defensive and get outbodied and outrun, if you play with 2 you need 1 who can win the ball back.Quite a few more things but these are the big and important things.",reddit,0
HAVERTZ DEFENDING?WHICH UNIVERSE IS THIS,reddit,0
 Wow what a goal that was a worldclass shot.We have to stand up again and do sth,reddit,0

France is up 7-0 and Upa is still on the pitch btw,reddit,0
ugh Trapp had that,reddit,0
How is thst not a yellow for the turkish player?,reddit,0
 I understand Nagelsmann is trying new things and want to give everyone a chance but instead he should probably settle for a team that works and this one obviously didn't. So close to the EM he basically should've already decided who is in the team and who is not.,reddit,0

" It feels like our midfield is actively waiting not to pass to Sané when he can make a run, only when he’s literally next to a defender they decide to pass. It’s so infuriating to watch, like what the fuck are you waiting for?",reddit,0
what on earth was that by Yildiz,reddit,0
 Somehow I expected this,reddit,0
" German commentary praising Groß again, but I don't understand why",reddit,0

"i think brandt would be such a baller if he was our player, but bvb pulls all players down",reddit,0
 I'm fine with this penalty. He wasn't in sprint excusing the arms moving excessively and he looked at him before he crossed in.,reddit,0
 Damn Gnabry,reddit,0
How did he miss that,reddit,0
" You start havertz, you get sacked. It’s been the way since the inception of havertz. No manager is immune to havertz. Nagelsmann if he’s smart, will realise the curse before he gets the pink slip",reddit,1

 Gundo is a criminal for not returning that pass on the wing. That was a full on counter waiting to happen,reddit,0
 Sané looks completely checked out,reddit,0
Interested to see how Havertz works out as L(W)B,reddit,0

I like Henrichs so far,reddit,0
That pass by Kimmich wow,reddit,0

Come on Gündo. Just kicked it straight at the defender in front of him lol,reddit,0
Uh oh... Smells like a harsh pen,reddit,0
 Tah should play as RB and Hummels next to Rüdiger,reddit,0
 That's 100% a penalty,reddit,0
 I dont know if Müller on the bench will ever feel right,reddit,0
Kimmich has been so good,reddit,0
 Ref that's not a pen...,reddit,0
 \^gnabry how on earth do you not go with your left foot first,reddit,0
what even was henrichs doing? is he not the RB,reddit,0
" Gnabry has been Thunderstruck, we gotta find the white boy that got his power",reddit,0
" Still think Germany has a better chance of winning the euros than England, for example.",reddit,0
" Suggesting that 3 at the back is a good idea with this squad is a sackable offence. It just shows such an awful lack of tactical awareness, historic source digestion and creativity. It’s like suggesting we don’t play with a goalkeeper or putting Havertz in defence.",reddit,0
I feel much more comfortable with Trapp in goal than Hair Stegen,reddit,0
What position is havertz playing,reddit,0
" Hansi Flick wasn't the problem, but he definitely had too much trust in Kimmich and should have done more to keep Kroos.My opinion keeping player like Hummels, Boateng, and Muller away from the team after 2018 really hurt the identity of the team. I actually think that the 35 Yr olds Hummels and Boateng would be a better pair than anything we have seen so far, obviously never going to happen. This group can still win the Euros but it will have to come from an entire overhall within german football. The question is can Nagelsmann be the one to orchestrate this change.",reddit,0
 not ready to watch havertz play,reddit,0
tersetegen with the ball is a horrorshow,reddit,0
How can we watch in the US? I cannot not find it,reddit,0
Come on then let’s see how it goes. Bizarre lineup but Nanglesmann has got the big calls right thus far!,reddit,0
"Credit where credit is due, that was nice!",reddit,0
 That was bad by gündo,reddit,0
 What do all these managers see in Havertz really? Like... why do so many want to die on this hill out of all hills? I really thought Nagelsmann would be pragmatic but he just can't help himself can he?,reddit,0

No matter what happens - I am proud of how this team recovered from 2017. In saying that - we have a great chance of doing this. The 2 last euro cup finals we were against the world champions and were absolutely not favourites at all. I don’t think we’re favourites now - but it’s as close to 50/50 as it’ll be IMO,reddit,0

Between Brexit and Covid, we’ve been in such a miserable and divisive way in Britain. To be honest, Prince Philip dying really personifies the way things have been the last couple years. But we finally have something to be proud of, something to cheer and be happy about. Something to actually bring this country together. I have so much respect for the Italians, I truly mean it when I say let the best team win. We are two countries where football isn’t just a sport, it’s a religion. We are just as passionate and love the sport as much as each other. Regardless of the result, I am proud to be English. Good luck out there tonight boys, let the three lions roar!

I've been negative about our chances throughout this tournament. It helps protect me from disappointment but also the fact I've been here before with England albeit not in a final. Italy are a class side. The best team at this tournament. We've done well but they've been exceptional. I see them doing us 2-0 and looking comfortable.I watch out of hope than expectation.

"1. A lot of people had problems with his attitude when he was playing. He always seemed like he was lacking motivation. 2. Made the famous pic with Erdogan. While Gundogan apologized for taking it, Ozil called everyone who criticized him for it a racist and islamophobic. 3. Had Erdogan as his best man at his wedding4. As a tattoo with a symbol of the grey wolves. They’re a nationalistic, racist and far right organization. Ozil as a player was class, as a human being he’s not so great I guess",reddit,1
" Read the newest Interview with his father, he is talking what the big problem with his career was. Got every opportunity in Germany and was the poster child about good integration, but called a dictator his president as german. After critics, tried the racism card and now has turkish right wing tatoos.Good player, bad workrate and really dumb.",reddit,1
 absolutely incredible player who then downed tools for years and has dodgy political views and affiliations,reddit,0
"didn't know about it too, saw him talking shit about Zinchenko the other day, guy is hella vocal about politics it usually come with a lot of hate",reddit,1
 Supported a man that people really didn't like much,reddit,0
He is just a scumbag,reddit,1
1. Accused of being lazy 2. Made a post calling out China for their treatment of the local Muslim population. Arsenal didn’t have his back and the fans called him “political” 3. Open “support” of Erdogan. 4. Accused the DFB of Islamophobia 5. Refused to cut his wages during the pandemic I like Ozil and think that some of these accusations lack context and are circunstancial at best. Football Iconic made a really great video about Ozil that I highly recommendhttps://youtu.be/8dIQ56YACvE?si=fgADRHdiCkqG387P,reddit,1
 Supported a dictator. Called him “My President”.He wasn’t really a revolutionary player. A classic playmaker that lacked consistency to be considered one of the true greats.,reddit,1
 He's the antisemitic bream.,reddit,1
"He acted like a man child at Arsenal aswell. Managed to turn the narrative on his side that the only issue Arsenal had with him is the Uighur stuff. That was a shit move from our club but he had massive issues here prior. He was a big reason Emery got sacked because Emery hated his attitude and began benching him, but Ozil turned the squad against him instead.Freddie also openly criticised him and Arteta also became fed up with his attitude in the end and finally cast him out. He sat on a monstrous contract he wasn’t justifying and was a big part of our shit locker room mentality but he always had god tier PR that made him look the victim no matter what.",reddit,1
Nice guy until he posed with Erdoghan and turned fascist,reddit,1
Outwardly support an absolute right wing nut job politician.,reddit,0
" I mean, he's a hypocrite. You play for the German national team and then after you are out of favour you turn out to be a Turkish nationalist? So far that you get a gray wolves tattoo.Only ultra nationalists and some fenerbahce fans are buying that tbh.",reddit,1
 Got a tattoo of a facist organisation,reddit,1
 His political ideology doesn’t align with the Westerners.,reddit,0
I remember when Germany played against turkey on a Wednesday. He was injured allegedly. But then at the next Saturday he played again for Real Madrid. He is the most opportunistic player ever.,reddit,0
People don’t like him because of his political opinions as they act like they’re experts in Turkish politics. As a player I can agree people would consider his mentality weak or unprofessional,reddit,0
"Political matters. Had a picture with the Turkish president 2 months before the 2018 World Cup , where Germany as a whole messed up the entire tournament , and got blamed for the disaster. Then expressed his support to Uyghur Turks which leaves Chinese under blame , who had a huge chunk of stocks at Arsenal, which ruined it entirely for him",reddit,0
 Openly supporting any right-wing politician = cancelled. That’s all you need to know.,reddit,0
 He was honest about his political beliefs unlike almost every other footballer and got hatred for not apologising like Gundo did. He also had a ‘lazy’ play style that is a lightning rod for criticism unless you’re winning every game.,reddit,1
"Had a close relationship with Turkish president (dictator) Erdogan, supported a far right Turkish terrorist group, acted like a Turkish nationalist but refused to join Turkish National team and he lied about it saying he wasnt invited to the Turkish National team, also accused his german teammates of racism, when he arrived at Turkey he was really underwhelming at Fenerbahce then ended his career at Istanbul Basaksehir (A team that is owned by president Erdogan and his far right buddies)",reddit,0
Because he supports a boarderline terrorist.,reddit,1
 Never moved faster than a light jog and couldn't tackle,reddit,0
The moment he showed his Muslim identity he became public enemy for the bigots and Islamophobes. Including Arsenal reprimanding him for speaking out against the plight of the Uighurs at the hands of the Chinese government.,reddit,0
He advocated for muslims in Uyghur. And you know how the prem is. If you support a blue eyed and blond haired human being you’re good but how dare you support a muslim terrorist right?,reddit,1
" In terms of being underrated on the pitch, just his casual and undemonstrative body language. Everything was so elegant he made it look simple and easy, whereas someone like Connor Gallagher steams around crashing into people and cant pass it ten yards but is lauded as a team player.In terms of hatred almost certainly rooted in Racism and Islamaphobia. He famoulsy said when i win Im German when i lose im Turkish. He called out the inhumane treatment or Uighur Mulsims in China when Arsenal did a promotional tour there which was the end of that relationship.He is a great footballer and human, among the most philanthropic out there.",reddit,0
Germans are S tier racists and don't consider anyone who is not white as germans. They have learnt to hide their true self but sometimes they show their true colours.,reddit,1
I mean Germany does have a history of racism and discrimination.,reddit,1
"he didnt had the mental capacity to overcome racist slurs he was facing. dunno why he didnt turn to some professional support etc. to overcome it and then had some faux pas like the erdogan pic for what he got critics but combined with the racial/german turkophobia it was a grossly exaggerated reaction from german medias/germany overall. now they had a reason to be dismissive and hateful. it was justified now and didnt need any implications or between the lines to slur him. and imo he lost the overview and instead on focusing what he had he tried to compensate it with turkeypholia aka ""now more than ever"" because his homeland kinda didnt feel home-ish. latest downfall is his grey wolf tattoo. they are a turkish right-wing extremist movement. he is a grown man and is responsible for it by himself. but imo it is pretty sure that the systematic german turkophoby gave him the kick in that direction. ""OG germans dont like it when (turkish) migrants sit at the same table with them. they are used migrants/deutschtürken stay on the floor"" is what a migration researcher once said. now obviously there is (more) change but during özil s rise it was more than ever present. it was that generation that didnt depend/want depend/needed to depend on low income jobs like their parents/grandparents. gündogan is an example that overcame that system. i am more than sure he had to suck up a lot of german bullshit in order to stay where he is now. özil on the other hand is now just a shallow shell of turkish propaganda. That's there so low profile germany football ""analysts"" can dismisse his past influence and success.to say how exagerated german media was on özil. neuer once sang a croatian nazi song during his croatia holiday. 0 consequences or public apologies. gundogan didnt only apologize he had to openly prove ""his loyalty to germany"". özil didnt want to bow too low and tried to explain it.",reddit,1
"People are soft and dont really understand people nor politics, easily triggered, misinformed etc.. also not to mention the whole turks in germany situation, incompatible cultures and all that. It really doesnt matter, Ozil is one of the most attractive mids that ever played, i enjoyed every minute of his field time. Long live Ozil!",reddit,0
 He spoke facts.,reddit,0
 He called out China for the uigher issue..China buys and sponsors alot of arsenals stuff.,reddit,0
" Being lazy on the pitch. And it’s not a myth either. There are numerous examples from highlights alone where you can pin at least a portion of the blame on Ozil for not bothering to track back or just dangling out a lazy leg. The Bayern thrashings were the perfect example of this. One or two goals where he lets Robben come inside, drift past him, then just jogs back at a snail’s pace.",reddit,0
 He reminds me of Berbatov.Amazing skills but seemingly no effort.Some of his assists were crazy good.,reddit,0
" Yeah he wasn't the most professional, plus he's been controversial on his political views. It's a shame, because talent-wise he's definitely one of my favorite players. I don't care much for Real Madrid but I got an Özil jersey just because I was fascinated with him.",reddit,0
I felt he was very lazy.,reddit,0
"As a player from my understanding, his downfall at Arsenal was people wanted him to track back but he never did that in Germany or Madrid. People dislike his politics",reddit,0
 It was so disappointing,reddit,0
 Nobody hates him all at all. Calling out an over rated player is not hate,reddit,0
"I understand people may not like him as a person but just like with actors I kinda like to stick to what they do as a professional, he's a football player you either like him on the pitch or you don'tIdc who their best friends are or their political opinions",reddit,0
" Man just stopped playing football at a semi-decent level... He could've done so much more but wasted his time and picked up his wages... Him and Hazard... Both were EXCELLENT players, don't get it twisted... Could say the same for Bale... Just coasting, picking up money and offering very little",reddit,0
 he preferred to act like a German during his early career and prime time and then decided to act like a Turkish when he got old/ his career started to decline. This is because he knew that he would benefit from being German in his very first years (German national team is far superior)and then he was acting like he rememberred who he actually was.,reddit,0
" I think you should look up the definition of revolutionary.He was good at his best, but he didn't change the way the game was played.",reddit,0
" A superb athlete loses all motivation upon achieving quite a lot to be fair. Mou read it early enough to boot him to Arsenal where he somewhat revitalized his ambition but petered out quickly. Also, his nonchalant body language was viewed by fans as a sign of not caring enough for the game and the team. Similarly, Berbatov and Arshavin were hated for their ""laziness"". But there is a room for players with this approach to the game and it is exactly why they find time and space to find that killer pass or a flick of a ball to leave the opponents frozen. On top of that you have your political and societal bullshit that only takes away from athletes than anything else.",reddit,0
That stupid Axel F song.,reddit,1
His entire career was based on a four week decent bit of form at the world cup,reddit,0
Well it’s more the fact he exists really,reddit,0
" He’s conservative and a nationalist, something Reddit user do not like.",reddit,0
 Sorry can somoneExplain precisely what the grey wolves are.Confirm that the tattoo is specificly endorsing the grey wolve causeOr have any documented evidence of Ozil endorsing fascist or right ing ideology.,reddit,0
Was a solid human being and muslimPeople hate that,reddit,0
"“Revolutionary”? Not really, zero teams came knocking for him. Zero.",reddit,0
"Ozil posed for a picture with the Erdogan that was captioned MY PRESIDENT, as you know, Erdogan is Turkish. Then, QA he called out the Chinese government for the genocide of the Ughur Muslim minority, which caused China to pressure Adidas into dropping him and letting it be known that no matches featuring him would ever be shown in China.....",reddit,0
 You mean aside from being the single laziest defensive player in the modern era (and that’s including MLS Messi) AND supporting a fascist???Other than that I can’t really think of anything.,reddit,1
He has some views that the Western world dont agree with and people have since used those to justify hate and amplify his other apparent flaws. Its certainly overblown and a lot of other players are free from criticism for similar views/actions with their nation & heritage. Being nationalistic and right wing isnt something unique to Ozil - many footballers are but none get the hate like Ozil.Shitting on Muslims is trendy and closet Islamaphobia probably play a part too.,reddit,1
Overrated player for a guy who couldn't score goals or defend.,reddit,0
 Lack speed.,reddit,0
" Stupid people will always look for reason to hate on someone. Ozil is a footballer and a fantastic one, and football is the only thing that matters. Everything else is just celebrity gossiping.",reddit,0
Played for arsenal,reddit,0
 1. Received German hate for taking Pic and supporting Erdogan2. Received hate from China for supporting Uyghur Muslims. Arsenal had to sideline him fearing they would lose the Chinese fans and their market in the future,reddit,1
 His eyes were offside,reddit,0
" Grew up in Germany, profited off the German system, became rich in Germany. Continued by supporting a dictator who at the time (and still) was very, very anti-Germany, calling us Nazis for not allowing him to do his election campaign in Germany. Did not apologize for basically calling a foreign president ""his president"", a man who hates Germans. Instead, Ozil said that everyone was racist and islamophobic. Then, he got the tattoo of a fascist organization (which is against Jews and also Christianity, something not really popular here anymore).Lastly, he still only holds the German passport while living in Turkey, acting Turkish. Just a hypocrite, a racist, and a stupid person overall.",reddit,1
 He played for arsenal,reddit,0
" Fascist supporter, like Neymar.",reddit,1
He spoke against china's policy on the uyghurs,reddit,0
 turky stuff,reddit,0
"Lives as free and secular as possible, supports radical Islamists in Turkey.",reddit,1
"Özil was a slightly frustrating player to watch. I thought Arsenal fans were too harsh on his performances, but I do understand the frustration. He looked like he wasn't trying, he calmly walked up to the ball and tried a little flick. The brilliance of him doing this was that, at least sometimes, he would look bored and not interested as he played a perfect 25 yard pass. By only looking at Özil, it would be impossible to predict what he was about to do.",reddit,0

YESSSSS BENUCCIIII,reddit,0
LET'S FUCKING GOOOO!,reddit,0
I have no dog in this fight just happy to be here.,reddit,0
Henderson with the dive lol. I bumped my nose!,reddit,0
Italy are not letting england bully them,reddit,0
I almost came when I saw the englishman lose,reddit,0
ahahahahahahahhaahahha,reddit,0
I've been a football fan since the early 90's and I'm English.,reddit,0
Wow. How unexpected for England to Lose in their first Real test.,reddit,1
We're all going England crazy!,reddit,0
And the fucking british scored fuck them!,reddit,1
Italy heavily in control here. Good thing England goalie came in clutch!,reddit,0
How was that not a red?!,reddit,0
England players diving all over the place there lmao so embarrassing,reddit,0

"This German team has ""limps out in Round of 16 exit at the EUROS"" all over them...",reddit,0
Abdülkerim played the match of his life. What a beast.,reddit,0
I have said it before but we really have lost our defensive identity.,reddit,0
not so bad for an away game for germany,reddit,0
the Döner guy next door yelled into the street that his Döner is 50% off tonight,reddit,0
My man Julian thought playing Havertz as LB would fix our defensive problems,reddit,0
Germany have conceded 20 goals in 9 matches.,reddit,0
Wtf did Havertz actually play LB? Didn't see the game lol,reddit,0
how was Yildiz,reddit,0
Our NT is definitely on a roll after the Montella hire but this German team really doesn't belong in the top tier in this current iteration. Idk where you start fixing it.,reddit,0
Abdulkerim Bardakci is a good defender.,reddit,0
This is gonna be a long week with my german turkish friends telling me Bayindir is better than prime Neuer Yildiz being literally a better talent than Messi etc.,reddit,0
Turkey deserved the win! Good job boys. Keep up the good work in European championship,reddit,0
That 4-2 defeat with Santos gets worse by the day jesus christ,reddit,0
Nice W.,reddit,0
I know it's a friendly but we're looking pretty scary,reddit,0
Still think that the lack of a proper 6 is the main reason for our defensive issues.,reddit,1
abdülkerim will probably make a transfer. first the united game and now this game. bro's on fire,reddit,0
Turkey Dark Horse for the Euros but dont let it blind you from the fact that we are still shit,reddit,1
Nagelsmann cooking,reddit,0
These comments from all sides are hilarious lmfao fun game for sure.,reddit,0
That was disappointing. Onwards to Austria now!,reddit,0
Wirtz is unstoppable man it's a joy watching him! I am watching every single leverkusen game thanks for him.,reddit,0
One of the most entertaining friendlies I've seen in forever,reddit,0
So many car horns last night,reddit,0
Hard game for Germany in an away game.. ah wait,reddit,0
excited to see this team at the euros!,reddit,0
Flick out,reddit,0
home game advantage ^^^/s,reddit,0
Nagelsmann 4d chess hoping to get a ski holiday from the dfb and then be replaced by Tuchel,reddit,0
well this match confirmed it every turkey group stage match at the euro will be a home game. germany was getting booed for the entire 90 min on the ball in their nations capital kinda pathetic honestly lol,reddit,0
Truly is stunning how utterly dog shit Germany are with so much talent,reddit,1
Maybe Germany are just...bad?,reddit,1
the comments aren't loading but if it is people saying dark horse again i will explode,reddit,0
Couldn't watch the game today. So from the score line it looks like Germany did a flick era performance.,reddit,0
What a fucking match. Bangers.,reddit,0
In those trying times I can always cheer myself with the fact that Germany sucks too.,reddit,1
Turkish left flank with kadioglu and yildiz was superior in the first half,reddit,0
Havertz is a strange player,reddit,0
if we actually have a good group we can really pull a morocco but euro version. considering this team will also have güler and ünal.,reddit,0
Did I just read Kai Haverts on the score sheet?,reddit,0
Pascal Gross providing defensive stability was sorely missed,reddit,0
Havertz is the NFT and Kimmich the Napoleon of footballers,reddit,0
The Turkish commentator was amazing the entire game this really felt like a final,reddit,0
At this point Germany is because a Turkish Ice Cream man when it comes to their performances,reddit,0
Didn't watch I'm a massive Havertz fan (I know I know he's not that good) But  I need to watch just to see how he was at LB,reddit,0
The more things change the more they stay the same,reddit,0
This German team is pants.,reddit,0
Gun to your head name one memorable Leroy Sane moment for the national team,reddit,0
It's always nice when the first team plays with their reserves team,reddit,0
Maybe Havertz at LB wasn't a master stroke after all 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔,reddit,0
Trapp got done dirty by this defense,reddit,0
EURO 2008 revenge,reddit,0
Honest question. What is going on with the german national team?,reddit,0
We can always go lower and lower it seems,reddit,1
Tough loss albeit by way of a stupid pen.,reddit,0
Germany losing is always a good time even if its just a friendly.,reddit,0
I love how everyone tries to find a position that Havertz is good and still fails lol,reddit,0
No idea why anyone would still start Kimmich in any squad considering his performance in 2023,reddit,0
What a game,reddit,0
Kuntz out - > Kuntz in?,reddit,1
Sighh disappointed. But we will return stronger,reddit,0
All the racist germans are gonna be triggered the turks won lmao,reddit,0
I'd trust Trapp ahead of Ter Stegen if Neuer can't make it. And least Trapp doesn't concede every goal on target and is a good penalty saver.,reddit,0
This game was good. We played good and deserved to win. Also with rotated squad.,reddit,0
Sad for Kai the LB he had a good game pen ruins it and its not like he did something stupid to give it away,reddit,0
The US should have competed better against Germany. Germany looks vulnerable in transition.,reddit,0
Praying for the german bros stay safe this night lmao,reddit,0
This is huge,reddit,0
i dont like a single player from our current starting 11,reddit,0
This germany is screwed while leroy havertz gnabry and company are their main attacking players.,reddit,0
Turkey will kill the Germans tonight,reddit,1
Wirtz please come to arsenal 🙏,reddit,0
Fuck the German team they cant even hit the ball right,reddit,1
**GIFs / Stats / Quotes**,reddit,0
no disrespect but turkey look like the worst team at the euro,reddit,0
An uninspired team invisible attack useless midfield subpar defence. Good thing the way home back is not that far.,reddit,0
Ramsey is different fucking gravy in a Wales shirt man. What a performance!,reddit,1
Disgrace. No tactics whatsoever.,reddit,0
Turkey are one of the slowest international teams I've ever seen. It's like one of those FIFA challenges where you have to play with a full team of 30 pace players.,reddit,0
Hopefully this teaches everyone to never ever bet on us rip people's reddit tokens kek. We have 11 guys on the field looking at each other confused while everyone else has a team that's always been the case.,reddit,0
Turkey must be the biggest let down so far,reddit,0
Bale missed a pen and still MOTM. Turkey poor once again. Good watch though,reddit,0
Turkey have been the worst team of the tournament so far so much for darkhorses lmao they've been dogshit,reddit,0
Turkey wish the feed glitch lasted entire match,reddit,0
I'm so disappointed in turkey.,reddit,0
It might not have the goals in it but this was the most entertaining game yet,reddit,0
That second goal felt surreal.,reddit,0
That game felt like it was inside the last 10 minutes for about an hour. Brilliant fun to watch,reddit,0
That second goal is actually huge.,reddit,0
Only France (6) have more wins than Wales (5) in the European Championships in the last eight years.,reddit,0
Such an entertaining game! Go on Wales!,reddit,0
turkey dark horses huh,reddit,0
if bale had scored that pen this would've been the best individual performance of the tournament by far,reddit,0
Awful from Turkey. Fitness levels are seriously abysmal do they just scoff doner meat wraps before the game or something? I've never seen a team this gassed.,reddit,0
fucking brilliant fair play wales,reddit,1
Over the bloody moon. So proud to be Welsh.,reddit,0
Truly one of the most embarrassing performances of all time right? Wales should have put 5-6 past us.,reddit,0
Class especially first half passing and movement was brilliant. So happy to see we've evolved a bit from just being a defensive team we were 5 years but does help we are more well rounded now.,reddit,0
Time to go through the predictions thread and bathe in the shower of shit we received from Turkish fans thinking that we were a nothing team. Glorious!,reddit,0
I feel light headed from celebrations lads what a performance from the boys🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿,reddit,0
Can't even describe my disappointment.,reddit,0
So happy for Wales.,reddit,0
Has there ever been a manager sacked mid tournament? Senol Gunes surely deserves it.,reddit,0
Fuck the haters Savage you keep going babes 🥰,reddit,1
We're too bad. The players had no idea how to play. I'm genuinely baffled as to how these players have had success in Europe. Especially Burak Yusuf & Zeki.,reddit,0
What a fucking win!!! I'm off to get smashed,reddit,1
What even was this game lol. So frustrating yet so entertaining. Pure chaos.,reddit,0

golden generation of turkey my ass holy fuck were these last 2 matches horrible.,reddit,1
Turkey getting massively outplayed and losing in Azerbaijan?! This is fucking delicious.,reddit,1
Turkey is the worst team of the tournament their attacking quality is shit,reddit,0
Two things I want to say:,reddit,0
Yh i have officially lost all my tokens,reddit,0
I get what I deserve for looking forward to this tournament.,reddit,0
I put 100 tokens on Turkey lol. I'm so shit at betting.,reddit,0
Bales attitude for Wales vs club football is day and night.,reddit,0
The ball itself played better than Turkish team.,reddit,0
Bale is the best British player of all time 🐐,reddit,0
HOW GOOD IS CONNOR ROBERTS???,reddit,0
What a great fucking game man. Pure passion,reddit,1
Congrats to Wales. They deserved it. We are absolute shit. Shocking performance.,reddit,0
Wales turned those dark horses into a glue...,reddit,0
Wales first team through to knock-outs?! Incredible.,reddit,0
Penalty aside that was man against boys from Bale absolutely class apart out there,reddit,0
ITS FUCKING CLASS BEING WELSH,reddit,1
If you hit me with a hammer I probably wouldn't feel anything. I'm depressed lol. My day is genuinely ruined and I hope I wake up tomorrow in a better mood.,reddit,0
Good fucking show cunts 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿❤️,reddit,1
Feel sorry for the Turks went there on vacation as a kid and everyone was very kind. Just weren't good enough though looked like this was their first game together so a team with plenty of talent.,reddit,0
What a game by Bale despite that penalty miss.,reddit,0
And just to think. This is what the Irish could be if we were just fucking Welsh.,reddit,1
It's pretty impressive how Wales went from never attending anything to reaching knockout stage two times in a row,reddit,0
Can't stress enough how much I hate Robbie Savage,reddit,0
"Some of the best feelings is when you see supporters crying in the stand specially when it's not a ""big"" nation. Nice to see Wales winning here!",reddit,0
Rip Turkish from AFTV,reddit,0
Only France (6) have won more matches across EURO 2016 and EURO 2020 combined than Wales (5); Wales have the best winning percentage in European Championships history (63% 5/8).,reddit,0
turkeys defense looks horrible,reddit,0
Congrats Wales! ;),reddit,0
wales deserved atleast a couple more,reddit,0
Turkey most disappointing team in the tournament. They need to figure out what the hell is going on.,reddit,0
What an embarrassment utter shite display well deserved for Wales.,reddit,1
People were hyping Turkey up before the tournament but they've looked absolutely terrible.,reddit,0
Man if James had end product...,reddit,0
Turkey are the dark horse from 'Godfather',reddit,0
Wales have a 63% win ratio in the Euros the highest in the tournaments' history,reddit,0
Wales. Golf. Madrid. **IN THAT ORDER**. I love Bale,reddit,0
Wales is all but guaranteed to go through now. Congrats to the Welsh fans.,reddit,0
Very impressed by Wales today. A lot better attacking wise compared to their game against the Swiss.,reddit,0
Fair play to Wales but Turkey has taken a massive dump on this tournament they are not having a good time.,reddit,0
Bale and Ramsey were immense. Turkey were horrible.,reddit,0
Turkey were shockingly bad wow.,reddit,0
One of the best Turkish side ever on paper and yet the worst one I've seen. Zero passion.,reddit,0
If Wales can get to second in the group they've actually got a really decent run for the next few games.,reddit,0
one of the best moments of my life feels surreal. we've fucking done it.,reddit,1
Soyuncu the only player who can actually defend today for turkey,reddit,0
So fucking proud right now. Never thought we'd qualify for a Euros let alone two let alone get our of the groups in both.,reddit,1
Can somebody ELI5 why the commentators so sounded certain that Wales is going into the round of 16?,reddit,0
I'm English but I can't help rooting for Wales in their games so much soul in their squad.,reddit,0
Is bale good or is turkey just dogshit,reddit,0
Can you imagine a team losing 4-2 to this Turkey?,reddit,0
Wales could have legitimately scored five. I don't know what the fuck happened to Turkeys defense but they were awful,reddit,1
More Dead Horse than Dark Horse,reddit,0
Petition to rename Wales to Bales,reddit,0
Baku is a salt mine right now,reddit,0
I can't help but root for Wales there's something about them that makes them likeable.,reddit,0
I don't understand how Turkey is so trash. Slow unorganized don't even seem interested in attacking either. They have some good players surely have to do better than this. Deserved win for Wales.,reddit,0
I don't care what people say bale is a roll royce of a player even after that missed pen,reddit,0
Couldn't be prouder of this team. From top to bottom they were superb fantastic performances all round. Joe Allen has become a meme but fucking hell he was solid today with some really nice reads in defence love that lad.,reddit,1
Think we can all agree Joe Allen was MOTM and some Prem club should spend way too much on him ASAP,reddit,0
Winner of this game? The Dutch and the Germans no Turkish Autokorso happening,reddit,0
I thought Ben Davies was great but that was absolutely stupid at the end. Savage embarrassing himself by ignoring it too.,reddit,0
The Turks are Twitter are gonna go massive lol,reddit,0
"Heard a guy the other night flexing about how much he spent of Turkish players for fantasy and how he ""knows turkey more than any other team in the world."" Enjoy last place in your league lol",reddit,0
Wales look like a real team they're going to have a good tournament again.,reddit,0
That sprint from James near the end was incredible,reddit,0
That Bale / Ramsey connection is something else,reddit,0
Bale really loves Wales,reddit,0
Bale deserves to go get a quick 27 in,reddit,0
GET US TO THE KNOCKOUTS SUPER AARON RAMSEY,reddit,0
Wales played good football. We played bad football. Well done Wales.,reddit,0
I'm laughing my ass off at the comments prior to the Euro regarding Burak Yilmaz.,reddit,1
why wont the mods pin anything on this sub?,reddit,0
Brexit?,reddit,0
Ampadu looked mature  during that scrap towards the end,reddit,0
Mental how we're the best team in the history of the Euros.,reddit,0
The whistling and booing in the stands was generally getting off my nerves lol,reddit,0
Bale motm he was really good. Watch him revive his career at the euros.,reddit,0
What a shit performance how do u let bale do the same thing twice?,reddit,0
Turkey looking like a headless chicken out there,reddit,0
What an embarrassing tournament for Turkey. Absolutely toothless in attack and horrible defence. I won't miss them,reddit,0
"Lmao cheeky ref. ""I'll let them play it in to the Welsh half and then blow""",reddit,0
De Boer is a twat,reddit,0
Wasn't necessarily why they lost the game but you can basically sum up Turkey's defensive efforts today by letting Bale spin away after pretending to hold it in the corner giving up a great chance conceding a corner and letting him do exactly the same thing again,reddit,0
Icing on the cake that goal for Roberts he was fucking sensational throughout.,reddit,1
Those four cards in the end saved my bet lmao,reddit,0
What a banger of a game. Enjoy Wales fans!,reddit,0
My congratulations to Wales from Kurdistan,reddit,0
Yes Turkey was poor but I want to talk about one of the unnoticed players of the day: Joe Morrell. I watch a decent amount of football and had never heard of the guy but he had a good game. He seemed to be everywhere just like Ramsey.,reddit,0
Wales vs Italy is gonna be a spicy one.,reddit,0
Ramsey MOTM?,reddit,0
hakan ready to go to maldini and accept anything he's offered. mans a perennial choke artist. should be no where near milan. spurs is a perfect place for him,reddit,0
I honestly thought everything in football had been tried out by now. But no... Gareth Bale apparently waits till the Euros before inventing a new type of corner kick. One that's so devastating he can get away with it twice on the run.,reddit,0
pain,reddit,0
Fuckin hell boys that was a bit special wasn't it?! Cymru am byth!,reddit,1
My call of Wales winning the Euros inches ever so closer to fruition,reddit,0
I liked Savage on commentary,reddit,0
Turkey's defence was genuinely terrible. Don't know what the commentator was talking about praising Soyuncu towards the end maybe it was one of the only players they know? While Wales were running at them they just backed off committed cynical fouls and allowed Wales to walk right through them. Last couple of minutes was a joke from them too,reddit,0
It's the history of the ottoman,reddit,0
Find it extremely funny everyone saying Italy are the main contenders after France because of their match versus this Turkey,reddit,0
I've never seen “nazar” hit us so badly. What a disappointment.,reddit,0
Turkey is dissapointing but also Wales is underrated tbh. They've been solid for a minute now.,reddit,0
As an Armenian fan thank you Wales,reddit,0
maybe the best performance in the tournament so far if Ramsey could have finished it would have been reflected in the score.,reddit,0
Bye bye Turks lmao,reddit,0
Bale with the performance of the tournament so far,reddit,0
my ears hurt,reddit,0
EAT SHIT ERDOGAN,reddit,0
Get fucked Baku and Turkey! We're on the move!,reddit,1
Llongyfarchiadau Cymru,reddit,0
I really wish Wales hadn't scored that second goal at the end. It's not good for us if it comes down to GD lol,reddit,0
Anyone else get really annoyed by Robbie Savage's commentary? Him simping for teams gets really fucking annoying after a while. I understand it's the BBC but ffs,reddit,1
Ro16 baby,reddit,0
Turkey pretty much no chance of getting through now with a -5 goal difference.,reddit,0

Well done to Wales but damn they didn't make it easy for themselves!,reddit,0
They'll be dancing in the street of Eglwyswrw tonight!,reddit,0
I dont understand Turkey literally only conceded 3 goals in the qualifers and they beat France and drew against them as well…,reddit,0
YEEEEESSSS. Gareth ffycing Bale. So so secsi,reddit,0
Congrats Wales although the best five minutes of that match was the bit where all the pictures went wrong and nobody had to listen to Robbie Savage.,reddit,0
Feel like I've run a marathon that was fucking exhausting. Massive win though! Also lovely to see Roberts get a goal too he deserves it,reddit,1
Fucking Wales go on rooting for you lads from Bulgaria,reddit,1
Turkey tried to do the pass to the forward and do a flick thing so many times and it failed miserably every time,reddit,0
good thing I have double nationality,reddit,0
Turkey looked like horseshit against Italy but that's Italy so may be they were just outplayed by a better team.,reddit,0
Senol Gunes is the worst coach of the tournament.,reddit,0

Two suits just walked right in front of the camera when France lifted the cup! ,reddit,0
Literally the first bad call the ref makes and it's potentially game deciding...,reddit,0
Bad call leads to a goal,reddit,0
Imagine the state of this sub if Griezmann dives to win a pen scores it and does the fortnite celebration. ,reddit,0
I have to say this has been far more exciting than the past two WC finals. ,reddit,0
I hate the fans that run onto the pitch and ruin the play,reddit,0
Imagine runninng onto the pitch during a World Cup final IN RUSSIA.,reddit,0
Subreddit about soccer world cup final is not a sticky post. Never change mods...,reddit,0
as sad as it is thats 100% handball,reddit,0
What the fuck is Subasic doing? Does he even care to make an effort? ,reddit,1
>lots of fouls,reddit,0
This final did not disappoint,reddit,0
How isn't that a yellow card?,reddit,0
Fucking pitch invaders ,reddit,1
Props to Mbappe for not taking advantage of the opportunity to go down in the box. ,reddit,0
Croatian defense is fucking breaking down. What a calamity. ,reddit,1
What. This fuckin game man.,reddit,1
Mandzukic being the real MVP and scoring for both teams,reddit,0
should be corner,reddit,0
Croatia did an amazing job during this WC they should be very proud.,reddit,0
Damn the WC is over :(,reddit,0
No matter what happens today I'm so incredibly proud of Croatia for making it this far. Win or lose we made history making it this far and if we lose to a team like France I can't be upset.,reddit,0
Antoine sleazeman,reddit,0
THAT WAS A DIVE,reddit,0
Yeah fuck France,reddit,1
"""There doesn't have to be contact for a foul to occur"" Alexi Lalas defending Griezman's dive. Are you fucking serious? FOX with the most trash coverage. ",reddit,1
Dumb move now Putin's going to give you pitch invaders the fucking nerve agent ffs,reddit,1
send to gulag,reddit,1
SUITS + MILITARY COATS ARE NOT HOW YOU STREAK,reddit,0
Fucking hell mate wait til the match is at least almost over.,reddit,1
Single ticket to the Gulag!,reddit,1
RIP those 3 people ,reddit,0
Lads it's Tottenham.,reddit,0
Imagine doing that in the world cup final ,reddit,0
That's why they say that 4-1 is the most dangerous lead. ,reddit,0
Lol wtf. Commentator just said the ref was a prison guard in an Argentinian movie. Said he was type cast LMAO,reddit,0
Varane at 25 has 4 CL and 1 WC what a player.,reddit,0

Get ready for 70 minutes of france not playing football,reddit,0
Game fucking on.,reddit,0
Ooooeee good thing it's still 0-0 in the 34th according to our thread,reddit,0
Can France ***earn*** a goal if they insist on being in the lead?,reddit,0
Surely should be more than 3 minutes the penalty alone must've been more than that,reddit,0
France is legitimately just stumbling into a win lol. ,reddit,0
Fans running out on the field in Russia? Wow they really must want to die or something ,reddit,1
How the fuck did people get past security guards placed every 3 feet ,reddit,0

Here comes the time wasting bullshit again,reddit,1
Good playing Croatia. Much respect.,reddit,0
Why the fuck are you playing Pirates of the Caribbean? At least play We Are The Champions or something,reddit,1
`Pogba.exe has stopped responding`,reddit,0
The tears of the Croatian president makes me sad :(,reddit,0
Croatia's president is so touchy. I like that.,reddit,0
LOL! Umbrella for Putin  not for the presidents of Croatia and France ,reddit,0

I just hope croatia fire keaps burning for euro 2020,reddit,0
1 shot 2 goals,reddit,0
KARIUS RETURNS FROM THE GRAVE ,reddit,0
I will have nightmares of that first half but France did better in the second they executed their game plan to perfection we just couldn't break them down.,reddit,0
Alexi Lalas just said the Griezmann dive was a foul and that “there doesn't have to be contact for it to be a foul”. God I'm ashamed to be American whenever he opens his mouth. ,reddit,1
Croatia's dominating. Except the score.,reddit,0
France won the world cup but Croatia won the hearts of the world. Croatia keep your heads high that was a phenomenal effort. Modric you're  a gem! ❤,reddit,0
Fortnite celebration should be instant disqualification from World Cup,reddit,0
Hmmm that dive though ,reddit,0
that already leaves a bad after taste and the match is so young,reddit,0
It's far from over Croatia has been threatening the entire time France looks like the worse team so far and got bailed out by the dive,reddit,0
France already crying about calls after being gifted a goal ,reddit,1
JUSTICE!,reddit,0
Croatia:,reddit,0
#WHAT A FUCKING GOAL,reddit,1
OG Check,reddit,0
Lmao goes back for another look,reddit,0
I'm all for keeping the game moving but for instances like this the clock has to be stopped. ,reddit,0
Ref has extremely large balls,reddit,0
Cringe,reddit,0
Fucking fortnite celebration,reddit,1
"My mom just asked ""So they have to take the penalty from the spot in the box where the handball was?""",reddit,0
Croatia clearly better side in the 1st half. Quite a bit unlucky tho,reddit,0
Really entertaining first half though I feel like 3 minutes of stoppage wasn't nearly enough when you factor in the replay ,reddit,0
France is playing pretty disappointing tbh,reddit,0
Did Lalas just say there doesn't need to be contact to be a foul?,reddit,0
This sums up this World Cup perfectly. An own goal a set piece and a VAR penalty. Classic ,reddit,0
What kind of shit show is this ,reddit,0
Love how they didn't even try to show the dumb ass intruder so they didn't get the attention they wanted.,reddit,1
There are hundreds of yellow shirts lining the field.  How does that happen?!,reddit,0
France was so good defensively against Belgium now they're giving away chances left and right. Croatia unlucky not to have equalized yet. ,reddit,0
Pogba with a terrific pass then finish,reddit,0
What is Subasic doing?,reddit,0
All the extra minutes catching up to Croatia now.  Referring decisions haven't helped them but those are some tired men.,reddit,0
This is the first time I've seen Croatia shook this tournament. ,reddit,0
hahah now this is a shitshow,reddit,1
Wtf is this game?,reddit,0
Wtf this game is insane ,reddit,0
Lloris is a fucking dumbass,reddit,1
France choking this would be hilarious,reddit,0
WELL DONE CROATIA!!! KEEP PUSHING AYEEE,reddit,0
Wtf is this game,reddit,0
Croatia cannot afford to play for the next 20 minutes like it's over. Because it's not. ,reddit,0
Oi ref fuck out the way,reddit,1
Goals scored in this final = Goals scored in four previous finals combined = 6,reddit,0
Remarkable run from Croatia regardless well played HRVATSKA.,reddit,0
Looks like France are gonna be out in the groups in 2022.,reddit,0
France won but Croatia played outstanding great job to the winners and runner up! ,reddit,0
Brutal. Congratulations France,reddit,0
Really sad but this was a really beautiful game. And a final. You don't see that so often...,reddit,0
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS MUSIC??,reddit,1
Modric with the Golden Ball well deserved. Courtois also well deserved,reddit,0

r/soccer is gonna be very salty tonight,reddit,0
Smh at all these racists saying that the French team is just Africans. Majority of these “African” players were born in France and without French youth development they wouldn't be the players they are today. They are French no matter their ethnicity. ,reddit,0
That  take the L celebration wont sit well ITT lol,reddit,0
Stoppage time is football's biggest downfall. Why not just pause the fucking clock when shits going on.,reddit,1
Croatia definitely the better team. France ahead with two lucky chances. As long as Croatia hold up at the back I see them tying the game at least in the second half. ,reddit,0
Feels weird to see a tottenham player lift a trophy. ,reddit,0
What is the point of VAR if they can't use it to tell the referee if the player is diving.,reddit,0
this is all the tears of r/soccer,reddit,0
Where the fuck did Will Smith come from?,reddit,1
My heart is checkered red and white today.,reddit,0
dive LOOOL,reddit,0
If they score it's more evidence for expanding VAR,reddit,0
Griezmann you fucking twat,reddit,1
OP terrible with updates.  How is this the official thread?,reddit,0
I'm sure this VAR call won't create massive amounts of salt.,reddit,0
Damn Subasic.. my heart stopped for a second,reddit,0
Only 3???,reddit,0
Why are France playing like they have a lot less talent? So timid and cheap,reddit,1
Should be 1-1 right now and Croatia is playing better.,reddit,0
LMAO 4?,reddit,0
Imagine doing that infront of 2 billion people,reddit,0
G U L A G ,reddit,1
Throw them in the gulag.,reddit,1
Congratulations; you've won an all expense paid trip to Siberia!,reddit,0
I don't mind if France win off goals like that. I'm still hoping for Croatia ,reddit,0
Ok now France can say they earned this. 2 legitimate uncontroversial goals vs Croatias 1.,reddit,0
Fun fact:,reddit,0
~~2018 is the year of the keeper~~,reddit,0
I can‘t get over Lloris‘ fuck-up holy shit,reddit,1
Best World Cup final in a loooong time just by the amount of goals and funny shit that's gone on,reddit,0
This final already has as many goals as the previous 4 combined. ,reddit,0
Props to Croatia for never giving up,reddit,0
Should have been a corner.,reddit,0
First world cup final in 16 years to not go to extra time.,reddit,0
It took me a fat minute to understand what was going on,reddit,0
That was me when I moved to Dubai in the 2000s and went to school there. All the Muslims greeted me this way and thanked me for killing all the Jews.,reddit,1
Shouldn't this sort of fans behaviour result into heavy penalty to the team?,reddit,0
Was that michael ballack and oliver kahn?,reddit,0

Come on germans—attack the iranian fans already.,reddit,1
They do a little trolling 😂,reddit,0
Jus som gud ol' shithousery simple as,reddit,1
Lmao,reddit,0
The fact is Iranians fans at that time didn't khow the meaning of this symbol and they thought they're honouring the German players and fans.,reddit,0
That's funny,reddit,0
This was pretty funny,reddit,0
Germany is a democracy and Iran is what it is 🤔🤔🤔,reddit,0
Iranians are such informed people NOT.,reddit,0
In our defense about 90% of them didn't know what it actually meant & they thought it's just the general military salute in Germany we we're trying to show respect & love towards the German team but we fucked up gloriously!,reddit,0
There were 100 thousands people in the stadium find the extended footage & see how many did the salute... besides it wasn't thought thoroughly in our schools since the holocaust denial was part of Islamic republic policy so people had to search & study it on their own,reddit,0
Isn't that how shit talking about works? lol,reddit,1
Gross,reddit,0
If they were meaning to piss germany off they did it if not... wtf was going threw ya alls heads,reddit,1
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I remember this . It was gold . German players were shocked and confused as fuck,reddit,1
Perhaps Iran wasn't wrong after all. Germany is supplying the nazis in Ukraine.,reddit,1
what is the compultion to go digging for imaginary nazis?,reddit,1
I mean they're not wrong!,reddit,0
Jesus Christ look Iran great country but if they taunt their opponents in a football match by bringing back their past like that America might as well invade again,reddit,1
Germans and Iranians and Saudis should all be ashamed for their countries' horrible behavior towards Jews and Israel.,reddit,1
They're dabbing on the Germans /s,reddit,0
Well that was bold,reddit,0
"Surely gotta be regarded as an epic ""pot/kettle black"" given Iran's poor human rights record?",reddit,0
Ah yes the duality of the arians,reddit,1
Ironic given that fundie Muslims like the Ayatollah-led Iran were the spiritual successors to the Nazis.,reddit,1

Sadly I'm not sure if they were complementing or insulting the Germans based on Iran's stance of destroying Israel.,reddit,0
Someone forgot to tell Iran who won the war,reddit,0
Wow. I was told by a German that they despise that old German culture from WW2. Guess I was lied to.,reddit,0
Iranian who think that this shit is funny(they still do it to this day),reddit,0

Cant expect much from muslim animals,reddit,1
**JESUS CHRIST THIS IS BAD**,reddit,0
So my dumb ass totally got the flags mixed up and thought Germans where doing the nazi solute at first before a watching it back and realizing. ,reddit,0
Finally someone respects me!,reddit,0
Well it's sad that now they know what it feels like to live under such a dictatorship,reddit,0
Hey what's the name of the player that shows up at the end and is the first person in the first footage?,reddit,0
Man I only had two African players once both my central midfielders. It felt like they were gone half the season,reddit,0
Yeah man that really sucks! And it's always when there's crazy fixture congestions because of the last few UCL league stage matches.,reddit,0
i have 8 african players in my squad. 8. and 4 of them are regular starters. lost 1st place in the league during that time and never got it back. yeah i feel you.,reddit,0
Me with my Japanese development centre overseas and when the Asian cup roles around the youth gets a chance to step up,reddit,0
Said this and I'll say it again. If you want African players scout East Africa. You most likely won't find good players but the NT don't tend to qualify for AFCON.,reddit,0
Only good thing about having the long winter break in Denmark… never lose African players,reddit,0
[removed],reddit,0
Yea I refuse to sign African players because of this,reddit,1
Shit I regret signing Zambo Anguissa now,reddit,1
My south korean striker i used for easier matches and fixture congestion felt like he was gone for about 3.5 months during international duty.,reddit,0
Yeah AFCON is the reason I have avoided signing Onana on FM22. He is always available as a free transfer but being without my first-choice keeper for a month seems like a nightmare.,reddit,0
both my rightbacks are off to Afcon so I just switch to a 3atb for a month at least Mazraoui won it last time he went Lamptey didn't,reddit,0
Why bother with African players at this point really lol...,reddit,1
I mean sure AFCON is very inconvenient for teams with important African based players but you did this to yourself when you created that super team of players you knew were probably going to that tournament when it rolled round.,reddit,0
When I sign French players but they take up African nation's call ups. I am looking at you Dagba.,reddit,0
Never getting Andre Onana on a free again,reddit,1

Horrific touch,reddit,1
Man Utd has been on a literal mission to keep Bruno's assists as low as possible.,reddit,0
They are on a mission to waste Bruno's assist numbers,reddit,0
Ah if that would have been finished ...,reddit,0
Lovely touch from Garnacho to start it off. ,reddit,0
What a peach of a pass from Bruno,reddit,0
Bruno can't win with these cats,reddit,1
Thats the most organized Ive seen them in a while and they still fucked it,reddit,1
Heavy Touch FC,reddit,0
I have to admit I hurled a few insults at the TV then,reddit,0
unreal pass from bruno,reddit,0
He thinks he's playing FC 24 and gonna cheese the GK.,reddit,0
Damn that was frustrating I really thought they were going to score loool,reddit,0
The touch of a United right-winger...,reddit,0
At least he's rapid...,reddit,0
this is one of the counters of all time,reddit,0
Hit it first time son!,reddit,0
That pass was so perfect followed by a terrible touch,reddit,0
that outside the foot pass deserved a goal. shame.,reddit,1
That scripted fifa touch when the keeper rushes you,reddit,0
Lukaku-esque touch from Garnacho but still lovely run and move otherwise.,reddit,0
I miss the dayS when counter attacks where our DNA,reddit,0
Rashford Hojlund and Garnacho all had a shite second touch last night. We could've won 4-0 easily.,reddit,0
The footballing equivalent of a premature cum shot.,reddit,1
Damn what a waste.,reddit,1
Puro humo este garnacho,reddit,0
GOTTA find Høj there !!!!!,reddit,0
Ouch. Imagine ruining a perfect counter with that atrocious touch. Must feel bad,reddit,1
Great counter for nothing. Truly amazing.,reddit,0
And he woulda got away with it too without that villainous goalkeeper,reddit,0
I don't understand how you can call yourself a forward and fuck up a chance like this,reddit,1
He's no Martinelli,reddit,0
He's simply not at the level required yet. He might become very good in the future though.,reddit,0
Bro tried to clip through the GK like in a bugged videogame.,reddit,0
'We have Martinelli at home',reddit,0
ay bichito 😥,reddit,0
United playing counter football against Copenhagen. lol.,reddit,0
Man needs to improve quite a bit and tame his ego if he's gonna get anywhere.,reddit,0
The old long ball,reddit,0
Fucking idiot. He could have passed to the guy on left. But no.,reddit,1
Lol I do this on Fifa all the time,reddit,0
Wow what a fucking idiot,reddit,1
Liverpool would've scored that.,reddit,0
Clown show.,reddit,1
Lazios goalkeeper and harry maguire both have a higher goal tally in the ucl this season than all of United's forwards in their last three games. United also won all of their last three games…,reddit,0
Touch to make Greenwood proud,reddit,0
Hojlund is **suffering** with our selfish wingers.,reddit,0
ive had nightmares about situations like this,reddit,0
Touch of a baby elephant at the end,reddit,1
United DNA,reddit,0
Rashford had almost identical chance.,reddit,0
Came here to see the video of hotdog counter opened in the stands as I didn't know ManU could counter on the field.,reddit,0
It resulted in a goal right? RIGHT???,reddit,0
Its not real M. United.,reddit,0
Lol,reddit,0
Warra finish,reddit,0
You would think the Argentinian would finish that.,reddit,0
Why don't we do this more often? I've noticed this season where we seem to always slow down the play after set pieces and corners which we should instead use to counter attack our opponents.,reddit,0
My first instincts say offside but I think he was barely on. Should've squared it for the finish.,reddit,0
Only good highlights are in his hair.,reddit,0
It's hard not to compare this Garnacho attempt with Martinelli's similar goal yesterday. One looked completely in control of the situation (and ball) and one didn't.,reddit,0
I'll watch any game if Miguel Simón is narrating.,reddit,0
Dribbles right to the goalie.  Great job bloke.,reddit,1
Worst team ever fr,reddit,1
Over hyped footballer forgot to kick the ball,reddit,1
Speaks volumes about the players and the club that no matter who comes in we still play counter attacking football because we have no clue about how to force teams open. I'm so tired of it.,reddit,0
The chip was there the keeper was far from goal,reddit,0
**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**,reddit,0
Netherlands vs France again? 😐,reddit,0
Group B is 2012 all over again.,reddit,0
how come Denmark isnt in the same group with France?,reddit,0
Damn. Mediterranean group of death,reddit,0
Worst possible draw for Albania 😭,reddit,0
Death Taxes Italy vs Spain in the Euros.,reddit,0
so we get pot1 just to get Croatia and Italy? fucking hell,reddit,1
Wtf is going on with the moaning bro💀💀💀💀,reddit,1
EURO 2008 - 2012 - 2016 - 2020 - 2024,reddit,0
Group B 👀,reddit,0
Kinda rooting for Greece in the playoffs but not sure the Ruhrgebiet would survive their match vs Turkey in Dortmund tbh,reddit,0
Group B must have done something to UEFA.,reddit,0
E is nice group of life,reddit,0
Group B is umm........yeah I feel bad for Albania,reddit,0
France again bruh,reddit,0
So glad our coach played Gavi every single game to ensure we qualified in 1st just to have the privilege of having a harder group than Scotland,reddit,0
Holy shit Albania we really got the hardest group,reddit,0
Why are the Belgians ALWAYS lucky with their draws. Sincerely a jealous neighbour from the north.,reddit,0
Why do we almost every time land in a group of death god damn,reddit,0
Very hard draw for Albania. Every goal they score will be a big success in a group like that.,reddit,0
EURO 2008 Group A: Switzerland Czechia Portugal Türkiye,reddit,0
Drawing England unfortunately just means the youtube “analysts” will give us plenty of air time..,reddit,0
Collective sigh of relief after Italy was chosen for Group B UEFA really didn't want to set off another Balkan conflict with Serbia in pot 4.,reddit,0
Group F: Porn Sounds,reddit,1
I feel like this is a terrible group stylistically-wise. We always run into danger when we play teams like Hungary and Scottland. Not to mention that matches with our german speaking neighbours are always weird.,reddit,0
WE'RE GONNA DEEP FRY YOUR…SCHNITZEL,reddit,1
Romania handpicking easiest opponents both in qualifiers and in groups. Tata Puiu mystic prayers seem to work.,reddit,0
I am sick of us playing against Spain over and over again.,reddit,0
Somebody got horny for Switzerland,reddit,0
Please please PLEASE let Greece win the playoff. Greece Turkey would be absolute insanity. Though on second thought maybe we don't actually want that. If there is one international game where people could die it's probably that one,reddit,0
I'll take that as a Scot,reddit,0
Death taxes Spain vs. Italy at the Euros,reddit,0
Group F turkey vs greece i will be there no matter what,reddit,0
Italy Spain and Croatia are not ready for us,reddit,0
"Really didn't want to draw Denmark. I know they haven't been good lately but I can't deal with the whole ""revenge for 2020"" storyline.",reddit,0
Looks like both of the semi-finals from Euro 2020 will be replayed in the group stage with Italy vs. Spain and England vs. Denmark.,reddit,0
B and D look insanely strong. The rest seem pretty tame.  Hopefully Austria can move on again,reddit,0
"Why does it have to be ""Turkiye""? We have English words for all other countries. Like Germany instead of Deutschland Spain instead of Espana. End this ""Turkiye"" stuff.",reddit,0
Was a pretty even spread until Italy got dropped into Group B,reddit,0
albania will top group B,reddit,0
I honestly think D is harder than B. Austria is very good rn,reddit,0
So Turkey will be in the same group as Greece as long as we qualify. That will go well.,reddit,0
HELLO PORTUGAL,reddit,0
We (Croatia) got worst group. Belgium and Portugal easy groups,reddit,0
The fucking moans lmao,reddit,1
Albania needs Skanderbeg to came back from the dead for that group...,reddit,0
I dont even want Poland to qualify anymore,reddit,0
I'll take that. We avoided Croatia Italy and the Netherlands as well as a potential Scottish derby.,reddit,0
poland would be better off not qualifiying,reddit,0
Ok sure we get Spain and Croatia but you also give us Italy bro wtf not cool at all,reddit,0
ok scotlands group is not bad. best team is germany who is in the form of their death,reddit,1
Albania got screwed over. Achieved to land in pot 2 to end up in *that* group.,reddit,0
I am liking the rematches. Germany/Hungary Spain/Croatia Spain/Italy England/Denmark Austria/Netherlands all happened last time round.,reddit,0
Group A looks like fun. Group B biggest group of death. Underrated one is probably going to be Group E,reddit,0
Group B is giving me 2014 World Cup Group D vibes. Albania pulling a Costa Rica would be great. 3 teams might still go through but I'm hoping for some sort of an upset.,reddit,0
We just played the Netherlands in qualifier and now we get them in our groups ??,reddit,0
Group c and potentially group d - the red white and blue flag groups.,reddit,0
It's weird to me that you can go into a group with a team you were grouped with in the qualifiers (looking at Denmark and Slovenia there might be others),reddit,0
group A and B are great. A gonna be scrappy,reddit,0
Albania and Croatia will battle for the custody of the Adriatic Sea.,reddit,0
Group B is going to be completely eliminated by the quarter finals as is tradition.,reddit,0
Surely our match against France will be different with all players available and healthy. Surely. :clueless:,reddit,0
Greece vs Turkey in the opening match of Group F if Greece wins Play-off C 🔥🔥🔥,reddit,0
Browho let the porn sound open?,reddit,0
I'm ready for Albania to win the group,reddit,0
Group F smells like 2004-2008.,reddit,0
Wait group A,reddit,0
Group B has to be a mistake because no freakin' way should Spain Croatia and Italy be in the same group all at the same time lol,reddit,0
Slovakia let's go ✌ Belgium is not unbeatable but of course I admire their quality and talent and Romania has been on the rise recently.,reddit,0
group b is a bit insane,reddit,0
Shit,reddit,1
That's a decent group for us. No reason why we can't get 7 points at least. To be fair though getting out of the group has never really been an issue for us (Brazil 2014 notwithstanding).,reddit,0
I'm excited for June bring on Spain Croatia and Albania!!!,reddit,0
It's joever,reddit,0
2 groups of death in 1 year I'm tired boss,reddit,0
One group away from thr third balkan war 😥,reddit,0
This is what we get for playing like shite,reddit,0
D-D-L vs Hungary since 2021 haha we are not winning that one,reddit,0
Romania got so lucky this time one of the easier groups if you look at what could have been.,reddit,0
B is group of death E is he group of life,reddit,0
If Greece qualifies they would play Turkiye,reddit,0
I wanted Group E but Group F was my 2nd choice.,reddit,0
We never lost against Italy. That's about the only positive from this draw.,reddit,0
Groups in order of difficulty imo:,reddit,0
Its rewind time,reddit,0
Play off path b is literally the war torn play off.,reddit,0
Little Silvio's Albania and Spalletti's Italy They did very badly,reddit,0
Maybe it's better that penalty wasn't given i like our potential group much more,reddit,0
I would laugh if Germany still can't get the job done,reddit,0
B stands for Banger group,reddit,0
Dread it run from it change your sports the Dutch-Austria anthem combo is inevitable ☠️,reddit,0
I swear Italy have been getting the shit end of the stick so often lately.,reddit,1
Germany will still find a way to not make it out,reddit,0
I reckon Scotland could sneak out of group A. With Germany's random form they could even top it.,reddit,0
Pretty fair groups with small outliers. European teams are pretty equal overall love that 24 can be part of the tournament,reddit,0
Group of death (b) v. match of death (greece - turkey),reddit,0
Turkey and Czech always find each other,reddit,0
Albania is thinking wtf cmon guys,reddit,0
Germany are fucking done,reddit,1
Was hoping for a Scotland game but got Denmark vs Serbia for the final group stage game.,reddit,0
Groups A B and D are looking to be good eats,reddit,0
Group A looking scary for Germany,reddit,0
Congrats to Scotland Switzerland and maybe Hungary proceeding to the next round.,reddit,0
Group A is honestly the group of death,reddit,0
Portugal cruising all the way,reddit,0
Group B is terrible for all the parties involved. It's likely they will lose a lot of points and won't have the 3rd best team to qualify,reddit,0
we could get a greece vs turkey,reddit,0
I hope romania qualifies,reddit,0
If Greece makes it out of the playoff it will be 2004 all over again for us...,reddit,0
Turkey vs Greece gonna be lit !,reddit,0
Excited to see Romania in a decent group.,reddit,0
Everyone believes that Greek and Turkish fans will slaughter each other in Germany but the Erasmus rules dictate that they're gonna end up being best friends and have gyros and döners or something.,reddit,0
There is a real posibility that Scotland will go through the group stage,reddit,0
Germany Hungary and Scotland? We're finished!,reddit,0
Shoot me,reddit,1
We're soooo fucked lmao,reddit,1
Shoot me,reddit,1
Wait the game my tickets are for is Playoff C v Portugal.,reddit,0
Türkiye with Czechia again. I wish Croatia would have been with us again. I think we can perform well in this group.,reddit,0
Already looking at England's path.,reddit,0
Poland needs to win playoffs so group D is just German neighbour countries,reddit,0
What did Albania do to deserve this.,reddit,0
Greece in our group would be juicy,reddit,0
We're a tiny bit fucked but going to get smashed at the games anyway so who gives a shit.,reddit,0
People saying Portugal have an easy group… not really? I think it looks like a good fun group,reddit,0
I am really pumped for that opener against scotland,reddit,0
Switzerland were somehow lucky again for being in Pot 4. Attractive and douable.,reddit,0
Getting Poland would be pretty funny flag-wise,reddit,0
I thought we had a tough one but fack me group B,reddit,0
Way better than last time,reddit,0
Kinda speaks for the belief in our team that I‘m not shocked we drew France and the Netherlands.,reddit,0
Half of former Yugoslavia qualified to the finals. And Slovenia and Serbia are in the same group.,reddit,0
Imagine being first draw and land in a Group with croatia and Italy.,reddit,0
Obviously and vexillologically the winner of play-off path A must be Peru.,reddit,0
Italy Spain and Croatia might have better players but Little Sylvio has the DETAIL.,reddit,0
Poor Netherlands just can't escape France.,reddit,0
What did Italy do to UEFA? 😂😂,reddit,0
As for team Portugal here I cannot complain 👌🏽,reddit,0
Rip Albania 🪦,reddit,1
I don't understand how France and Netherlands can be in the same group in the qualifiers and again in the finals? couldn't UEFA have prevented that?,reddit,0
Glad to see they gave Albania an easy group 🦅🦅🦅🦅🔥🔥🔥🔥,reddit,0
It's OK I didn't want us to qualify anyway,reddit,0
We coming for revenge get ready your diving aint gonna save you this time England,reddit,0
Hungary dark horses to win that group,reddit,0
Group toughness ranking.,reddit,0
Someone was enjoying the draw toooo much.,reddit,0
Group of death: Group B and D,reddit,0
Easy group for Romania. They will be the dark horse these Euros,reddit,0
England absolutely have no excuses not to make the final. Southgate being a football terrorist could sabotage us but we have (on paper) the most talented squad in the tournament.,reddit,0
Eh could have been worse for us,reddit,0
Really good draw for us imo,reddit,0
Literally Leverkusen's easiest game since the winter break,reddit,0
Jupp destroying his sim card right now,reddit,0
Neuer was closest to scoring for us today. Says a lot about the attacking tactics we have.,reddit,0
they fired nagelsmann on march 24th because the treble was in danger,reddit,0
0.27 xG. Thats the comment.,reddit,0
Fuck bro what a legendary interview by Thomas Müller. No filter just facts. The only passionate leader we have in this team.,reddit,0
Well Tuchel is done. Will be interesting to see if he gets fired right away or gets the season.,reddit,0
Atrocious excited to see how people will defend Tuchel after this,reddit,0
5 points ahead but feels like 35 right now,reddit,0
Jesus christ what a collective disaster,reddit,1
Bayern still looked like a top team when Choupou Moting was our number one imagine if julian had kane last year,reddit,0
Müller GOING OFF in the post match interview he will be an amazing coach,reddit,0
A caretaker manager would be so much better. The attitude of the team would change. Everyday with TT in charge the 'Bayern Mentality' dies a slow death,reddit,0
Get this fraud tuchel out. This is Kovac levels.,reddit,1
Nagelsmann was fired for less.,reddit,0
Müller so mad holyyyy,reddit,0
You don't even have to look at any tactical difference what matters is that I have *PHYSICALLY* watched this team get worse with my own two eyeballs since this guy took charge,reddit,0
Honestly I don't know what tuchels plan was going into this game. What was his idea of creating a chance?,reddit,0
.23 xG,reddit,0
Tuchel out,reddit,0
If Tuchel thought the media was harsh on him before today then he's going to be in for a shocking experience.,reddit,0
Nagalesmann Bayern failed to score a goal ONCE in 84 matches.,reddit,0
I prefer not to speak.,reddit,0
Tuchel goes 0/6  trophies and keeps the job will be the last laugh of this board. He should get no credit for the bundesliga title last year.,reddit,0
One game two stats. 027 xG and O shots on target in the second half.,reddit,0
Nagelsmann had to enjoyed this,reddit,0
We are leading in the training league though,reddit,0
Shitty lineup shitty tactics shitty result,reddit,1
[removed],reddit,0
When we dramatically won the Bundesliga I thought we turned a corner. Turns out there's still a number of problems with this team chief among them their mentality,reddit,0
"The [Bayern] team immediately went to the dressing room. Uli behind. Long faces shaking heads. Tel cheers up the dejected Musiala. And Kimmich yells through the dressing room: ""What a load of sh*t man!""",reddit,1
So how many more coaches are going to try and fail with 3ATB while taking Müller out of the squad?,reddit,0
Imagine saving the treble with Tuchel,reddit,0
Watching the press conference right now and watching Xabi speak has convinced me that he is levels above Tuchel.,reddit,0
Fuck Tuchel and fuck every player who's putting in a mediocre performance,reddit,1
Flick suicide ball was still better than whatever the fuck we did in this match. Crazy how we had 1 shot on target in the entire match.,reddit,0
What a boring fucking game. The entire season has been filled with these. Its like our team doesn't know how to attack. Its no longer enjoyable to watch them play. I watched an old game recently and I just wish that team was here to play today.,reddit,0
At this point Tuchel has shown that with Bayern he has no world class pedigree - fire him. The board should try to limit the damage as much as possible. Our standards are too high,reddit,0
Guys… Somebody please fucking call Heynckes dog and ask if he can finish the season in charge.,reddit,1
Name another coach who would start dier over de ligt. ,reddit,0
The overreliance on Musiala to bail us out of every press can only go so far.,reddit,0
Who cares training was amazing,reddit,0
Leverkusen wanted it a lot more.  They deserved this.  They have that team of destiny look this year.   Good for them.   They won't keep that team together for too long,reddit,0
Idk what Tuchel had in mind when he put Boey on the left side. He literally never played there for us,reddit,0
Tuchel out,reddit,0
Holy mother of god WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?,reddit,1
Probably the most inferior Bayern team i've seen ever play. Disgraceful with such a stacked line-up.,reddit,0
Players are bad we have an obvious lack of quality in some positions.,reddit,0
How we had players like Sane and Goretzka played for the majority of the game baffles me. Such a disappointing performance from the team.,reddit,0
"I did start saying sack Tuchel after the first match against Copenhagen. Got downvoted by those ""Tuchel's supporters"" without seeing the problems we are facing.",reddit,0
Tuchel tried. He can go now,reddit,0
Had two deaths in my family the past couple weeks and was hoping for some sunshine today…. Nope,reddit,0
Even tho i always hoped for the best but i kinda saw it coming. Loses dont hurt  but the fact we didn't even show a fight is painfull.,reddit,0
How are we supposed to go against bugger teams in the UCL if this is how we playing? Ridiculous,reddit,0
![gif](giphy|Grg6HRplAZtZ0Q7MIX),reddit,0
unacceptable fire tuchel today get flick until the end and look for a real coach and give him 2-3 years with the players he wants,reddit,0
I'm so out on Tuchelball football terrorist,reddit,1
TUCHEL OUT,reddit,0
TT = The Terrorist,reddit,1
The coaching situation at Bayern since Pep has been such a mess. The players have too much power and the coaching has sucked,reddit,0
Bayern haven't played back 3 for many times and Tuchel does it in the most important game of the season,reddit,0
Guys do you think there is something we can do to put the pressure on the board to sack Tuchel immediately?,reddit,0
Why is it so torturous to watch this team play?,reddit,0
![img](emote|t5_2sgxj|17995),reddit,0
I know that Uli and Kalle are still pulling the strings in the background but I am certain that if Uli was still president and Kalle the CEO Tuchel would be close to getting sacked.,reddit,0
tuchel out immediately,reddit,0
JN was not a perfect coach but it was his first big job and we were building toward something long term. The TT appointment set us back years and will possibly waste Kane's remaining productive years.,reddit,0
When  is the last time we celebrated any goal let alone a 3-0 like that last one?,reddit,0
Flick is available right now... Just saying. Could be a good caretaker.,reddit,0
when you're determination to individual tactics is so important that you put players who have almost no experience with their new club on positions where they have almost no experience in a formation where they have almost no experience,reddit,0
What a joke.,reddit,0
Es tut einfach nur noch weh,reddit,0
Imagine first playing a right back as a left back when having a natural left back on the bench then playing your left back as a right back and your right back as a left back. I can't undesrstand what went through Tuchel's mind today. This and the Werder's game cost us the league.,reddit,0
No words to utter from my mouth after seeing that shitty coach what a rubbish.,reddit,0
Hope that's the end of the Tuchel tenure,reddit,0
Curious to see how Tuchel defenders gonna defend this one.,reddit,0
I am not surprised. I've been saying since the start of the season that Tuchel has made Bayern too slow. We need rebuilding. Congratulations to Leverkusen they have been phenomenal all season.,reddit,0
Outclassed by the better team. Nothing else to say. Changing tactics to 3 at the back was a baffling decision. 0 creativity or intent in attack. Rip the Bundesliga streak Kane curse gotta be studied 💀,reddit,1
Yea Tuchel has to go . Yes players are an issue but what coach changes formation like this in the most important game of the season,reddit,0
teams used to be scared of us under JN man,reddit,0
It's gonna be alright. Not the end of the world if the streak ends.,reddit,0
Sane could've blocked the frimpong 's shot... didn't even try,reddit,0
RIP.,reddit,0
"How can you look at the first half at halftime and think ""alrighty let's continue just like that?""",reddit,0
Gotta give it to Leverkusen. Not a moment where you felt that they weren't in total control of the game. This isn't a fluke Alonso is turning out to be one of the great coaches.,reddit,0
![gif](giphy|GAzaXWl5r9bFOAOyR0|downsized),reddit,0
What happened to us after December break ? I know we were not solid  every game but Kane Sane and Tel were a danger to the opposition every time they had the ball.,reddit,0
*SIGH*. Sack Tuchel and bring Jupp out of retirement and have him take over till the end of the season for the 3rd time again.,reddit,0
Thomas although very emotional told it how it is very accurately!,reddit,0
Lothar spitting facts,reddit,0
Embarrassing,reddit,0
i finally know what depressions feels like,reddit,0
Why would you change the formation in the most important game of the season,reddit,0
Last time Sacha Boey played as a LB was in 2020 never at Galatasaray I'm appalled,reddit,0
Tuchel out,reddit,0
There goes the league. Heartbreaking. Feel for Kane.,reddit,0
Where are all the tuchel apologists now? I have said this from day one when it comes to actually good teams we are LEVELS behind. I honestly wouldn't be shocked if we didn't manage to get past Lazio as well. Such a disgrace. I thought last season would be our disaster and we would come back strong but this this is horrible.,reddit,0
Whatever happens - CL win or not title win or not we need to completely tear apart this team and rebuild from the ground up. At least the 2011/12 team fought and FOUGHT hard but this? This is a disgrace. Many of the players who now wear the crest - they should never have had it in the first place.,reddit,0
Sack him,reddit,0
Tuchel once again completely outclassed by a superior manager.,reddit,0
Failed once again the character test. How unexpected.,reddit,0
That Tuchel sacked notification is gunna hit like crack,reddit,0
Last year it felt like all we were missing was a good striker. Because we created many chances almost every game only to not take many of them..,reddit,0
I wish we could bring back JN somehow. It's like there's something cancerous with the core of this team and I don't know what it is. Half the time it looks like we aren't even trying.,reddit,0
Embarrassing performance yet again. Given how much better our squad is than any other in the league we should not be playing this poorly over and over and over.,reddit,0
I feel like we're relying too much on individual brilliance..,reddit,0
Tuchel made so many bad choices he's making Ale Moreno sound like Johan fkn Cruyff.,reddit,0
TT hasn't managed to fix the rotting core of this team over the last 11 months and it looks like he's getting seriously desperate.,reddit,0
I do think we need a new coach but wait to sack Tuchel until the end of the season locker room chaos is the last thing we need,reddit,0
FLASHBACKS OF TUCHEL AT CHELSEA,reddit,1
The social media team looked like it was hyping up the Super Bowl then this matchup and the effort on the pitch looks like it.,reddit,0
Today was shambolic as fuck but at this point just let Tuchel see the season out and see if he can salvage anything in the CL as unlikely as that seems. No point in sacking him right now. Caretaker manager isn't going to solve anything and there isn't anyone else really available right now.,reddit,1
Tuchel made an entire carreer just from becoming Klopp's successor. Finally he is getting exposed as a shit coach. It took long enough,reddit,0
Tuchel is like a tumor the longer he stays the more he's going to hurt this club.,reddit,1
It's Joever,reddit,0
Have at it Hamann,reddit,0
I can't believe I had hope going into this game. Let's see what Tuchel has to say now to defend this disasterclass.,reddit,1
I woke up at 4am and got smashed by a load of shit on my face.,reddit,0
#Well ... goodbye Tuchel? 👋,reddit,0
Leave TT on the tarmac.,reddit,0
nicely and thoroughly cooked,reddit,0
Ive never seen a bayern game with such less pace and FUCKING SANE why is he so annoying sometimes,reddit,0
Idk. We still average 2.38 pts per game last season we had 2.08. Leverkusen is simply so good this season. But yeah likely the BL is gone and this will be trophyless season which last happened in 11/12 season.,reddit,0
But... But... 6th best start in Buli history 😭,reddit,0
JOSE MOURINHO,reddit,0
we still have leipzig and stuttgart lol we are not winning the league,reddit,0

You cannot expect to win a game with just 1 shot on the target.,reddit,0
Destroyed,reddit,0
Remove Tuchel. Remove the entire board.,reddit,0

Probably a mixture of factors. 1) our media is particularly bad for overhyping our players which probably annoys other nations.,reddit,0
"For the same reason that one of the post popular holidays celebrated around the world is ""Independence from England Day.""",reddit,0
They made enemies with half the world for centuries lol,reddit,0
The home nations just have England because its England (I'm welsh can confirm),reddit,0
•Very egotistical media,reddit,0
Whenever I hear someone bashing England it's normally an English fan 😂 guess that's one thing England & Mexican Fans have in common.,reddit,0
"English ""fans"" destroyed the center of my town 2 times did the same in Lens back in 98 .",reddit,0
Because people don't read Spanish media which hype up the Spanish team all the time or German media which hype up the German team all the time or Mexican media which hypes up the Mexican team all the time.,reddit,0
In 1995 England came over to Ireland to play a friendly match. They go down 1-0 early on. Their reaction to this was to violently riot. The match was abandoned due to the mayhem.,reddit,0

Hate is strong I don't hate them,reddit,0

99% of English people I've met are absolutely rock solid. The colonialism would be easy to look past. Then their media steps in…,reddit,0
It don't matter if English never qualified again for WC EU's ,reddit,0
Honestly I think other countries just like to hate England for historical reasons which is fair I suppose but I really hate when you see significantly worse behaviour from European hooligans in France Italy Holland and there seems to be much less negative views on them,reddit,0
They hate us coz they aint us,reddit,0
Contrary to other comments i believe a lot of the hate comes from english folk themselves. They care so much about their domestic league that some of the passion is lost for their national team,reddit,0
For me it's because if you added up their individual fifa scores you'd probably have the best team in the world. And then you watch them pass backwards for 90 minutes and wonder wtf happened,reddit,0
Salty crybabies that can't handle the English fans having a bit of fun singing it's coming home.,reddit,0
I think they hate the English national team fans more than the team itself.,reddit,0
I don't mind people hating the NT but if you support an English club and hate the national side your opinion on anything doesn't count. No one stormed the beaches at Normandy in a Bayern Munich shirt.,reddit,0
Because it's the popular thing to do and people can't think for themselves,reddit,0
Two words: English Fans,reddit,0
Im Irish so....,reddit,0
Huge amounts of Europe are xenophobic especially towards English people so it gets them a chance to be xenophobes.  They then make up some BS excuses to justify being bigots.,reddit,0
It's mostly the media I guess. English is a universal language. People all over the world consume their media more than other teams. As a Spanish person you wouldn't know how the French German or Italian media are hyping up their own NT.,reddit,0
,reddit,0
Northern Irish I for one don't dislike the England team I'm happy they do well it's the newspapers and dicky commentators that just over hype you... They're the ones I can't listen too.,reddit,0
As a Scotsman having to listen to the UK media salivate over the England NT and constantly bringing up 1966 provides me with enough reason to enjoy seeing them lose. Bitter? You bet!,reddit,0
I hate the English men's team with all my heart ❤️,reddit,1
Who gives a fuck? If people want to lose their heads over us that's their business. Probably better to be hated than to be forgotten anyway. Don't be such a melt OP. It's unbecoming.,reddit,0
I think it's not again the NT itself but more against their fans who genuinely believe they are a historic top 5 NT when in all their history their biggest achievement is a WC won with a goal that didn't enter the net,reddit,0
Hate us because they ain't us.,reddit,0
I am simply very anglophobic I wish nothing but misfortune for Perfidious Albion and its awful food for all eternity,reddit,1
Imperialism,reddit,0
It has everything to do with the fans and nothing to do with the team itself,reddit,0
England have one of the most likeable teams people like to seem them lose because many of their fans are scum. For example the racist abuse hurled at Saka Rashford and Sancho following the Euro 2020 final.,reddit,0
The deluded media and fans.,reddit,0
I mean i just feel like they are boring,reddit,0
Hating the English national team has been the easiest most natural thing I've experienced in life. It could not be any easier.,reddit,0
There's the obvious point that many countries around the world hate England for historical/geopolitical reasons. But I think the number one reason is that their fans are incredibly toxic and obnoxious.,reddit,0
Because every time they beat Macedonia in a friendly 'Football's coming home' .,reddit,0
Because they are the most boring team to watch?,reddit,0
England is like the America of football. They think they are amazing because they never look at anyone else and dont realise how far behind they are so then when the conversation starts its awkward to tiptoe around their feelings.,reddit,0
We just get too excited it's the same with Liverpool highest highs and lowest lows and as a neutral it's kind of enjoyable,reddit,0
Colonisation,reddit,0

The worst part of this is that headbutt caused no damage at all. If you want to do this and get sent off at least throw a haymaker or a studs up kick to the stomach. Do some damage FFS.,reddit,0

Also this was one of the first examples of VAR ever. The referee didn't see the headbutt but the 4th man did and invited him to watch the replay on the stadium screens.,reddit,0
This was one of the best moments of football I ever watched. Though I remember it being much higher quality,reddit,0
That's some hard neanderthal skulls,reddit,0
It was their plan all along get zidane sent off,reddit,0
Screw them when Zidane became a manager of Real Madrid,reddit,0
Anyone find out what matarazzi said to zizu?,reddit,0
A fantastic re-watch to this day. Those teams just wow.,reddit,0
or the first ever case of VAR,reddit,0
This introduced me to Marco Matterazzi the butcher. That dude has some of the most heinous fouls you've ever seen. Borderline assault most times!,reddit,0
I watched this shit live,reddit,0
I was 6 years old and this is one of the two only soccer scenes I can remember entirely.,reddit,0
"This is basically ""the"" soccer game I remember. I am not a soccer fan. I just remember the stakes being so high tie game and just WHAT!",reddit,0
Greatest header.,reddit,0
I remember watching this. Italy really perfect the flop in this match. Zidane deserved the red but no way he decleated that dude like that.  Can't believe how long ago this was.,reddit,0
It's odd to think so many younger fans are only seeing this for the first time possibly ir never really knew the whole backstory and what it meant at the time.,reddit,0
Can't believe this was 14 years ago. I remember watching this live,reddit,0
Still the stupidest thing I have ever seen a footballer do.,reddit,0
Fuck Materazzi,reddit,1
I didn't get it then I don't get it now- why headbutt someone's chest? That's just a bit weird isn't it?,reddit,0
Part of the reason I bought a Zizou jersey... which i am incidentally wearing at the moment.,reddit,0
Stuff of legends,reddit,0
I fucking hated this World Cup. If I remember correctly Italy cheated to win against Australia. Then this shit. Then I don't even remember watching the final.,reddit,1
Dumbest move in the history of the World Cup. He threw away his country's chance of winning because Materazzi said something nasty about his sister.,reddit,0
I saw this on TV and cried when I was a kid,reddit,0
Probably my favorite thing i watched live the other one was the Ronaldo people didn't like taking a free kick to the nuts twice in a game.,reddit,0
I heard he cussed his mum,reddit,0
He really doesn't get enough shit for that imo. If I was a French football fan I would still be pissed for this stupidity.,reddit,0
Love this. Cost France the World Cup and was the last game of his international career. Because someone goaded him on the field. What a chump.,reddit,0
Dumbest thing he's ever done.. robbed himself and us of a great finish.,reddit,0
I will love Zidane forever for this.,reddit,0
Zidane is my hero,reddit,0
Haha - Van Bommel yellow in the 2nd minute. Typical.,reddit,0
The Battle of Nuremberg,reddit,0
Haha love this match. I don't know what's more embarrassing though our NT's performance or me as a drunk 15 year old absolutely loving it and hating everything Portugese for weeks. ,reddit,0
I remember watching that game live. Afterwards a dutch television show added up how much injury time the referee should've counted. I believe it was somewhere around 15 minutes.,reddit,0
Those Portugal kits are beautiful.,reddit,0
Terrible game great entertainment. I couldn't look away!,reddit,0
Damn if Van Bommel wasn't on my team I would hate him so much. I love him.,reddit,0
Overshadowed in this game was that the goal was actually really nice,reddit,0
"Amazing game one of the highlights of the tournament. Really annoyed me when all the pundits line up with all that ""This is not the sort of scenes we want too see in football"" shite it fucking is.",reddit,0
i kind of feel ashamed but .... Best. Game. Ever ,reddit,0
Somewhat surprising in the build up towards the Holland-Portugal game of the EC 2012 the Holland journalists were referring to the Portuguese as aggressive and sneaky.  At least I after this game and the world cup (final) in South-Africa would call Holland the overly aggressive team.,reddit,0
Man almost forgot how fucking awesome this match were. I just love how Deco kills that Holland guy after they refuses to give Portugal the ball back at the fair-play situation. Thanks for the video OP.,reddit,0
What do you want? Theres centuries of history and drama between us!,reddit,0
Ref had a field day that game,reddit,0
One of the worst and most entertaining games I have ever watched.,reddit,0
could have been worse we could have lost **the game**.,reddit,0
What a game!,reddit,0
Was such an epic game.,reddit,0
i kind of feel ashamed but .... Best. Game. Ever ,reddit,0
The ref went absolute bonkers on this one. One of the few matches I watched just for the ref and the fouls.,reddit,0
Shhh this never happened. ,reddit,0
I wish more games were like this. It's so much more entertaining. The only real rage I've seen this season was Simeone vs Varane and that didn't really go anywhere,reddit,0
Asian betters had a field day with this one.,reddit,0
This will maybe one of the few games of the Netherlands that I shall never forget. It was so full of action and fights it was a shame the game ended in 90mins and that we offcourse lost.,reddit,0
I haven't had such a good day today and the last thing I wanted was to look at Van Bommel's face. ,reddit,0
Fucking Van Bommel,reddit,1
Watching that game live as a neutral left me with a still-lingering distaste for both teams.  It seemed like every player left the pitch looking like a jerk to us neutrals.,reddit,0
What is it with Holland and high fouls in WC same in the final against spain in 2010 god that was packed with them. ,reddit,0
"Ah yes the usual anti-CR7 tactic: ""we suck let's break his legs.""",reddit,0
Came for the fouls. Stayed for that cunt Deco getting hurt. *cough* Celtic vs Porto UEFA Cup Final *cough*,reddit,1
