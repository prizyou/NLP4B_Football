0,"The DFB hired the wrong coach if their goal was to bring back pragmatic, result orientated football"
1,"Imagine living in foreign country, then go to a match and whistle on your host team."
2,"This is by no means racist because I don’t gibe a crap about the nationality, but this pointless whistling we’ve seen from the turkish fanbases is the lowest shit Ive seen lol"
3,"Ngl, these whistles really are starting to grate on my nerves. Need more goals to shut them up."
4,"I'm kinda lacking the imaginative power to see us do ""well"" next year"
5,"The fact that there is not a single  german defender in Bayern’s starting lineup speaks volumes. Gone are the days of Boa , Lahm and Hummels , Ginter etc keeping it safe and quiet at the back. Bayern need to speed up and intensify development of some home grown defending talents if they don’t want to continue outsourcing expensive transfers from outside the league.
As for Dortmund idk wth is up with Sule and Schlotterbeck just standing like two giant easter island dummies . If Rudiger could just put in some serious work in his performances like he does in his aggressive animated theatrics it will do him very well in the long run."
6,"can turkish fans just shut the fuck up for one goddamn match, nobody enjoys your whistling"
7,Who is this Serge Gnabry guy and what did he do with Sergio Gnabinho
8,"Unless the Turkish players all get possessed by scarecrows and we end the game with a 9-3 win, any outcome of this is embarrassing. We’re letting Turkey put 3 past us in Berlin? Come on I know we’re shit but still"
9,"Not a good match by Sané, he looks bored"
10,"This German team is actually hopeless, not even a Klopp-Pep combo can save this generation"
11,"Why are they whistling like it’s the world cup final?

Chill out"
12,I'm just gonna mute every game where any Turkish team plays and sing/chant myself. I can't stand this whistling BS.
13,This isn’t even a home match for Germany lmao. The crowd is so one sided.
14,Ich hab genug gesehen. Dann lieber die alten Herren Müller und Hummels
15,"German freunde, what would you say is the problem here? This german generation of players are not that good, the coach?"
16,Man I’ve never really watched/supported my other NTs but if we lose against Austria I might have to take a break for the Euros
17,After this game and the Gala games they will be burning effigies of Sané in Istanbul lmao
18,"why is the stadium speaker guy sounding so excited that Turkey scored, like bruh it's ok to be biased for Germany here lmao"
19,"We will need an entire bus of therapists for our German national team players, if Germany plays like this in the group and gets knocked out."
20,"I was optimistic over and over again and I got disappointed over and over again. 

For now, I lost all hope that these guys can grow together as a team. They just don’t fit. 
Literally every player has been tested in all possible formations and tactics. We even tried „the best coaches“ we have. 

The puzzle just doesn’t solve. 
We have good players, not as good as one generation before, especially in the Defense which is horrific right now tbh, but midfield and attack has great potential, at least in theory. 
But it seems they can’t be formed as a working unit. 

Maybe we have to accept and wait until it gets better. Our gems Musiala and Wirtz still have over a decade left. Plenty of time to form a team around them."
21,Getting drowned out at a home game is really something ngl. Was similar in the Gala game at home a few weeks ago as well. Not German but it kinda pisses me off
22,Being a bird near a Turkish football stadium must be a very confusing experience
23,Whistling is lame. Lord Kai please shut them up
24,Never seen a team celebrate so much in s friendly..
25,Well this is embarrassing
26,Man these tactics are questionable at best. I know it's a friendly but there has been no adjustment at all since going down 3-2
27,Can someone tell that Turkish player he can ask for Wirtz jersey after the match and not strip him during it
28,Turkey literally winning every second ball. How is the german team so consistently shit since 2018?
29,"Again on Henrichs side.. This time he has to step further into the field though, because the CB's are out of position and that leaves the wing open."
30,"Havertz giveth, Havertz taketh"
31,That damn whistling
32,Chances for a draw were there
33,Turkey away is always tough
34,I'm not overreacting but where do we guys meet after the inevitable euro 2024 win?
35,"https://x.com/dfb_team/status/1725973603043229890?s=46

No way these fuckers posted sad pikachu"
36,"Not exactly playing good football, are we.."
37,Zeit für ein Lahm-Comeback
38,I thought we were past the Sané wing back stuff…
39,"What do you think of Rüdiger?

I find him so unlikable"
40,"What we saw here was a typical JN Bayern game Imo

Set up the team extremely well and start well, but the moment the opponent team adjusts he’s out of his depth. Reason why we threw so many games."
41,"Cant play with a 3/5 defense when you dont even have the players for it sane and kai dont know the position to play the defensive part whole game with discipline 
And henrichs is wasted as rcb .
When pressed high the offense doesnt drop far enough back and there is a big space between def and offense which forces long high balls and we dont have players who can shield the ball or win a header fülle a little but not nearly enough.
Gündogan kimmich pairing is bad because they are both weak defensive and get outbodied and outrun, if you play with 2 you need 1 who can win the ball back.
Quite a few more things but these are the big and important things."
42,HAVERTZ DEFENDING?  WHICH UNIVERSE IS THIS
43,![gif](giphy|texPPGdPu32q4)
44,"Wow what a goal that was a worldclass shot.
We have to stand up again and do sth"
45,There are 3 players on the pitch who think of defending. What are you cooking nagelsmann
46,"that shot almost looks like a Kane shot, wtf"
47,France is up 7-0 and Upa is still on the pitch btw
48,ugh Trapp had that
49,How is thst not a yellow for the turkish player?
50,I understand Nagelsmann is trying new things and want to give everyone a chance but instead he should probably settle for a team that works and this one obviously didn't. So close to the EM he basically should've already decided who is in the team and who is not.
51,I liked Sané in the first 20min but otherwise he is rather bad sadly
52,No Müller no party
53,Getting Galatasaray flashbacks with these Turkish supporters.
54,My god Sané is up to something today
55,"Nice moves there, Julian!"
56,What a fuckin pass. Holy shit
57,"Just tuned in to the game and as expected are the Turkish fans whistling like crazy!

Also almost no German fan to be seen lol"
58,I want Wirtz
59,"I like that JN is actually encouraging the German side to drop back and play on the counter when needed, not just mindless high line defence like Flick's and Löw's tactics"
60,"Wish Yildiz didn’t leave Bayern, especially on a free. He looks like he’s going to be a good player moving forward"
61,No ThoMats tax
62,"we'll surely come back and win this 3-2, relax boys"
63,This is not an enjoyable game
64,"Jesus, the playing out of the back is terrible..."
65,"I have a bad feeling that Upa and King will play the full 90 lmao

e: King is out!"
66,France 11-0 that's insane
67,That was pretty nice by Henrichs.
68,And so the cramps begin…
69,Getting Olé chants against you in your own stadium is kinda nuts man.. lmaooo. Germany are finished
70,Ref whistling every time a Turkish player throws himself to the ground..
71,I know a lot of people who are going to be absolutely insufferable about this loss for the next few years
72,Banger tackle by Henrichs
73,:D Turkey playing this game as if it is a world cup final.
74,Oh wow
75,ThoMats lmao
76,The last 15min were boring
77,Bro wanted a hug
78,"The German team is so weirdly bad in midfield, just a total loss of control most of the time when you have players like Gündogan, Wirtz, Kimmich and Brandt who should hypothetically be in control"
79,What I like about current Bayern is that we are really good in reacting to conceded goals. Both Germany team and previous Bayern (with Julian and early Tuchel) seems to collapsing right away.
80,"It feels like our midfield is actively waiting not to pass to Sané when he can make a run, only when he’s literally next to a defender they decide to pass. It’s so infuriating to watch, like what the fuck are you waiting for?"
81,what on earth was that by Yildiz
82,Somehow I expected this
83,"German commentary praising Groß again, but I don't understand why"
84,The amount of runs Sane makes that get wasted or played too late is mind blowing
85,This is such an ugly game. Not even talking about the game/passes/strategies but the way the players on both teams behave.
86,The insane number of handball pens is ruining the game
87,Trapp even guessed the right way....
88,7 minutes?? just call it a day man lmao
89,Yildiz was one of ours and could’ve been a german national fyi
90,Estoy cansado jefe
91,Can I be a NT plastic and just claim to be french? I just want to watch decent games in the international break again.
92,3 at the back strikes again. When will managers stop with this shit. We should have just stuck with Voller lol
93,Sané you are a nasty mf
94,Our best defender sane
95,Did they just bring on Jack Grealish
96,"fuck it, I'll get a ticket for an EM match of turkey and I'm booing these suckers for 90mins"
97,Yildiz....
98,bangers only
99,Bro....
100,Nagelsmann should be jailed for this starting line up..
101,Is Yildiz also that good in his club?
102,CHAD
103,i hope we have wirtz already secured
104,Back to winning the Euros baby
105,"No clue if Wirtz has any clause in his contract, but at this point the guy should not cost a single cent less than Bellingham if Leverkusen isn't dumb"
106,comms between Kimmich and Leroy kinda off right now
107,France is up 9:0 and Coman is the only one who scored more than once lol
108,"i think brandt would be such a baller if he was our player, but bvb pulls all players down"
109,I'm fine with this penalty. He wasn't in sprint excusing the arms moving excessively and he looked at him before he crossed in.
110,Damn Gnabry
111,How did he miss that
112,"You start havertz, you get sacked. It’s been the way since the inception of havertz. No manager is immune to havertz. Nagelsmann if he’s smart, will realise the curse before he gets the pink slip"
113,Imagine telling someone a year ago that Havertz would be Germany’s best defender
114,Gundo is a criminal for not returning that pass on the wing. That was a full on counter waiting to happen
115,Sané looks completely checked out
116,Interested to see how Havertz works out as L(W)B
117,Turks and their whistling..
118,SANÉ! Thought he scores/shots himself
119,Whistle that lol
120,I like Henrichs so far
121,That pass by Kimmich wow
122,Ahhhh shit. That was a good shot tbf
123,"Damn, that was something and a half."
124,wtf
125,I mean his hand is in a natural position idk
126,my left back
127,Which pikachu gif are we using now?
128,ok right
129,[deleted]
130,These cutting passes by Kimmich and Gundo are orgasmic
131,"Deschamps, my man, what about subbing Upa and Coman"
132,Where was right back?
133,I honestly think we won't get Wirtz. He will be way too expensive.
134,"This team is a joke, we will get embarassed in the euros at home."
135,Wonder what playing against Turkey must feel like for Gündo right now.
136,Best LB in the world !!!
137,just put 100 on the table for wirtz
138,"Sane has to be a bit more selfish again, sometimes he could do it himself but he seems scared.
Hes still a worldclass player rn"
139,We should have played with the 1996 kits tonight the guys were wearing them before the game
140,Someone shoot plz 💀
141,Damn
142,Lückeee
143,Come on Gündo. Just kicked it straight at the defender in front of him lol
144,Uh oh... Smells like a harsh pen
145,Ffs
146,Tah should play as RB and Hummels next to Rüdiger
147,That's 100% a penalty
148,I dont know if Müller on the bench will ever feel right
149,Kimmich has been so good
150,Ref that's not a pen...
151,\^gnabry how on earth do you not go with your left foot first
152,what even was henrichs doing? is he not the RB
153,"Gnabry has been Thunderstruck, we gotta find the white boy that got his power"
154,"Still think Germany has a better chance of winning the euros than England, for example."
155,"Suggesting that 3 at the back is a good idea with this squad is a sackable offence. It just shows such an awful lack of tactical awareness, historic source digestion and creativity. It’s like suggesting we don’t play with a goalkeeper or putting Havertz in defence."
156,I feel much more comfortable with Trapp in goal than Hair Stegen
157,What position is havertz playing
158,"Hansi Flick wasn't the problem, but he definitely had too much trust in Kimmich and should have done more to keep Kroos.

My opinion keeping player like Hummels, Boateng, and Muller away from the team after 2018 really hurt the identity of the team. I actually think that the 35 Yr olds Hummels and Boateng would be a better pair than anything we have seen so far, obviously never going to happen. This group can still win the Euros but it will have to come from an entire overhall within german football. The question is can Nagelsmann be the one to orchestrate this change."
159,not ready to watch havertz play
160,let Naggy cook
161,tersetegen with the ball is a horrorshow
162,How can we watch in the US? I cannot not find it
163,Come on then let’s see how it goes. Bizarre lineup but Nanglesmann has got the big calls right thus far!
164,ok ok
165,Lesgoooo
166,"Credit where credit is due, that was nice!"
167,That was bad by gündo
168,nice
169,"What do all these managers see in Havertz really? Like... why do so many want to die on this hill out of all hills? 

I really thought Nagelsmann would be pragmatic but he just can't help himself can he?"
170,If England wins I'm not coming back to this sub until late-August transfer rumors
171,I look at the videos from Wembley and those poor moronic bastards that have gone too hard and too soon
172,"Fuckin bricking it , feels like a mix of Christmas Eve, Day and First day of school all in one"
173,No matter what happens - I am proud of how this team recovered from 2017. In saying that - we have a great chance of doing this. The 2 last euro cup finals we were against the world champions and were absolutely not favourites at all. I don’t think we’re favourites now - but it’s as close to 50/50 as it’ll be IMO

254,"I really hope we win tonight. But even if we don’t, I am so incredibly proud of England for getting to their first final of my lifetime. 

We really have had nothing to be proud of the last 2-3 years. Between Brexit and Covid, we’ve been in such a miserable and divisive way in Britain. To be honest, Prince Philip dying really personifies the way things have been the last couple years. 

But we finally have something to be proud of, something to cheer and be happy about. Something to actually bring this country together. 

I have so much respect for the Italians, I truly mean it when I say let the best team win. We are two countries where football isn’t just a sport, it’s a religion. We are just as passionate and love the sport as much as each other. 

Regardless of the result, I am proud to be English. Good luck out there tonight boys, let the three lions roar! COME ON ENGLAND!"

Italy are a class side. The best team at this tournament. We've done well but they've been exceptional. I see them doing us 2-0 and looking comfortable.

292,I’m shitting myself. No way I’ll make it to the final blow
293,"Right I’ve got a bucket of salt and whole selection of humble pie on stand by, do I need anything for the game?"
294,Twitter was a mistake
295,I'm planning on streaming on either BBC or ITV- anyone have an opinion on which streams better?
296,ITV had adverts already only been on 5 mins
297,"Confident Italy will win, why?

Sunderland never fucking win @ Wembley and I've watched them lose quite a few (EFL doesn't count as a real trophy) and England have two Sunderland players in a final in the team/squad including a goalkeeper."
298,Kane with a penalty early/maguire gets his big fucking head to score and then in the second half Italy crushes our dreams with 3 goals. 3-1 prediction you heard it here everyone.
299,Feel sick
300,Dropping Saka for trippier don't Calvert my Lewins

302,Garibaldi was a poor statesman

304,"Had a stone baked pizza earlier, listened to Mambo Italiano on Alexa while making it and will be pouring a glass of Peroni in a minute.

Respect the culture 🤌"
305,"Man, someone posted the statistic of days with rain in England... How the hell do you live with rain half of the year? It's got to be brutal"
306,"Watching all the videos, at least COVID is coming home."
307,What's going on on the BBC???  Did I take acid accidentally?
308,This BBC montage with people from their hometowns is actually great
309,25 minutes in and Rice has been the best player on the pitch.

311,"england is white

italy is blue

sterling can dive

312,Don't care who wins. Am here to see my man Björn Kuipers in action. :)
313,"Italy is goin to win 20-0. Even Donnaruma will score from a corner kick.
Will be the beast italy of the last 170 years!"
314,"My only wish is to see Italian players 
Singing ""It's coming home"" after they won"
315,"Europe: Why can't you just be normal?

British press: *screams*"
316,"I might be one of the only neutrals rooting for England lmao. Kane deserves a trophy, and I also like Sterling and Rashford."
317,"Forza Italia, win it for Spinazzola!"
318,"I ordered a pizza with pineapple


THE ARROGANCE"
319,I predict a comfortable 2-0 to England. Yes I'm drunk
320,Another UEFA fix. English rainy weather for the final
321,Never felt so much Italian in my non-italian life.
322,"VINDALOO 


Time to drink the fears away"
323,I'm reaching maximum levels of siege mentality
324,Win or lose london is going to turn into the purge when these finals are over
325,"New Order - World In Motion > Three Lions - Football's Coming Home, i will take that to my grave"
326,If Italy win I'm going to put pineapple on every pizza I have going forward
327,"I just wish English fans would stop doing hooliganish shit so they can be a neutral’s favorite. It’s all there to be a nice little narrative - first final in 55 years, Southgate’s missed pen - and yet you lot are trying your best to recreate 1987 outside of Wembley. Knock it off."
328,"I hope for an exciting game with thirty shots and 27 nice saves. 

Probably get a defensive masterclass from Italy, and a scrappy dull 1-0 though."
329,Wonder what genre of post game riot we'll see
330,Roberto Mancini will be just the second manager to have won the English top flight title & take charge of a European nation in a major tournament final Sir Alf Ramsey won the First Division title with Ipswich in 1962 & 1966 World Cup with England
331,BBC so we don’t have to listen to the inane drivelling of Sam Matterface
332,"Were people just as angry at each other before other Euro and World Cup finals, or is it more this time?"
333,"Gave my kid the Babybel with the Italian flag on the wrapper for lunch today

It's definitely coming home"
334,It is a bit sad that I’m going to be experiencing this at home by myself…
335,I’m watching some kind of pre game show and it’s not helping my nerves. I’m hoping berrettini’s loss was a sacrifice for a win tonight
336,I have a feeling we will have a winner after 90 min today (although I’d like to see the opposite)
337,Got to love Klinsmann.
338,Lads will there be drama?
339,As long as we don’t get twatted I’ll take it.
340,I expect high scoring match which means it will be 0 0 going to penalties
341,Another goddamn monochromatic matchup. No reason It can’t be blue/white/blue vs white/navy/white.
342,"I'll be getting home from my delivery job about 10 or 1030ish. This makes me probably the only person in the country who wants this to go to penalties, because the only chance of me avoiding the result until I get home and can watch on iPlayer, is if there *is no result yet*."
343,Anyone else feel sick?
344,"Jesus Christ it’s here.

Hoping for a great game and a great result. Will happily just take the latter."
345,where can I watch the game not 2 minutes behind on stream?
346,I love a game in the rain
347,Forza England!
348,Mai visto così tante gufi in un posto solo
349,Can you imagine how Southgate would feel if we won? Probably the only thing he feels would make up for his miss all those years ago (I remember seeing a vid of him talking about it)
350,Sterling player of the tournament would certainly cause some drama
351,I swear to god if Baddiel and Skinner come out of that trophy
352,"England v Ukraine was a fucking turkey shoot and we scored four minutes into that game.

I was NOT expecting the two minute goal."
353,Kane's first touch and ability to hang on to the ball has been so important. Got Italy on strings.
354,I'd like to reaffirm that Rice has been the best player on the pitch.
355,Surely Bonnuci has the experience and brain to not be that fucking stupid
356,"I respect the English team and their style, but I really really hope for an Italian win. But more than anything a well-played and well-refereed game."
357,Just leaving a comment here so I can re-visit all the hot takes in this thread more easily tomorrow.
358,I don't mind England beating us fair and square but I'm gonna be furious if there are shitty ref calls.
359,If we lose tonight I'm strangling me mam.
360,"The battle of the national anthems.

Ingurland!!!"
365,"Coming from a Scot good luck to both sides and enjoy yourself, I'll catch the result after work tonight"
366,CAM ON INGURLAND
367,"Just a friendly reminder that every big football nation knows how it feels to lose a final. That shit stays ingrained in you for life, nationwide. Eventually, the only way to wash it away leads to future wins (with the obvious exceptions). Losing a euro final is somehow less worse than losing a World cup final, trauma-wise, but it'll still be equally remembered. Good luck England."
368,"We would've won everything under Allardyce, the world just wasn't ready for it, what a shame."
369,[deleted]
370,"JUST HAD A SUNDAY ROAST

IT'S COMING HOME"
371,"Why are the odds so good for England? Italy have an insane unbeaten record, they've always been good against England in the past major tournaments, they have a more well balanced team, better manager and have beaten harder opponents along the way. All England have is a better squad and home advantage. Kane and Sterling also never showed up in the Champions League final. That will probably mirror this final."
372,If we do win the posts about the inevitable riots are going to be unbearable
373,"I hope the lads know that the whole country is proud of them regardless of what happens today. They have done incredibly well to get to the final, that is all you can ask from the team."
374,"It's the final already?

Hard to believe its 3 days since Sterling became the first player in history to go down easily after a knock in the box."
375,The Italian has just lost at Wimbledon. Foreshadowing?
376,I'm going to cut up spagetthi and serve it with ketchup.

379,5-0 italy
380,"Everyone All tournament: fuck Italy! Bunch of crybaby divers

Everyone during the final: forza italia!! Mama Mia! England is EVIL"
381,"My cousin was bottled outside Wembley, now he’s stuck in hospital with a concussion and a huge gash. These fucking scummy English fans. I’ve been impartial, but this is the final straw for me. Fuck these drunk degenerate knuckle dragging cunts."
382,I can't wait to see an overweight shirtless drunken Englishman crying.
383,"Im happy its getting played in England, because now they can destroy their own city instead of someone elses."
384,[deleted]
385,Watching the Wembley. Italy take it!
386,It's currently raining. England has 133 rain days per year compared to 88 in Italy. The stars are aligning. It only means one thing... Italy win
387,I’m so nervous! On the one hand I can see the English perspective of never being in a final for longer than I’ve been alive. But damn do I want to win.
388,Did anyone else see the guy dancing with his dick out in the street on Twitter?
389,"It’s coming to Rome, it’s coming to Rome
Footballs coming to Rome!!!!

Yassssssssss!!!!!!!!"
390,"Very excited. Don't think there's much doubt we've got the two best teams in the final, which doesn't always happen."
391,"Up at 3am in Australia, It’s coming home 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿"
392,Congratulations to England for finally winning the euros!
393,Just remember England was part of the allies and the Italians sided with Hitler.
394,I used to get annoyed by people's unreasonable hate towards England but at this point I'm just embracing it. Hope we win because of a last minute dodgy penalty
395,SCORE SOME FACKING GOALS INGERLAND WHILE I GO EAT ME SAUSAGE RALL
396,"Whatever happens, big Gareth has earned all the love in the world.

2018 and 2021 weren't even tournaments we were targeting winning originally but he got the whole country hoping and believing."

401,"Euro finals and NBA finals all in the same day 

Life is good"
402,"Alexa, play Zitti e buoni"
403,"I have to say I'm sympathetic to both teams tonight. I feel like Italy have looked better than England in this tournament but in football, that means very little. I think both teams can win this... All I want is a great game!"
404,england to tear down wembley stadium if they lose in penalites?
405,"Which channel are English fans watching on? I usually opt for the BBC, but I also love listening to Wrighty."
406,"I hope they cut to Becks a lot


That sexy lad calms the nerves"
407,imagine if italy wins by dive at 95'
408,Let's go boys
409,Just hope my heart is still good after this. Gonna look like Wayne Rooney after this ffs
410,I will have a pizza in the event Italy wins. Please recommend something to eat if England wins. Thinking of bangers and mash
411,"I don't want to tell Southgate off as he seems to enjoy proving me wrong, but hasn't he tried Walker on the right of a back 3 before.. and hasn't it looked terrible every single fucking time??"
412,This guy on my stream saying Italians are cunning lmaooo
413,England fans how nervous are y’all?
414,How to watch the match online?
415,Stewie Griffin
416,FORZA ITALIA CAZZO
417,"Even though I'd like England to win, I reckon 2-0 to Italy."
418,ITV or bbc ? Which to watch on who has worse commentators
419,Closing ceremony before the game?
420,"OH MY GOD, LOOK WHO’S BLESSED US WITH HIS APPEARANCE!"
421,They've already got Italian colours on the trophy. Rigged /s
422,is Gary Lineker drunk?
423,Why do I feel like we never know how to start our anthem properly? Like that one kid who always claps slightly off beat.
424,LETS GOOOOO
425,"Im Turkish. We don't like him because

1)Choosed Germany and said that he feels German

2)nothing wrong with that, but after Germany kicked him out he became a super turkish nationalist erdogan fanboy

3)literally said he is a fan of AKP(Erdogans party) propaganda tv shows

4)played like shit in Fenerbahce

5)played in Fenerbahce

6)played in Basaksehir(Erdogan pet project footbal team)"
426,He has a tatoo of a Turkish far-right organization.
427,"1. A lot of people had problems with his attitude when he was playing. He always seemed like he was lacking motivation. 

2. Made the famous pic with Erdogan. While Gundogan apologized for taking it, Ozil called everyone who criticized him for it a racist and islamophobic. 

3. Had Erdogan as his best man at his wedding

4. As a tattoo with a symbol of the grey wolves. They’re a nationalistic, racist and far right organization. 

Ozil as a player was class, as a human being he’s not so great I guess"
428,"Read the newest Interview with his father, he is talking what the big problem with his career was. Got every opportunity in Germany and was the poster child about good integration, but called a dictator his president as german. After critics, tried the racism card and now has turkish right wing tatoos.  


Good player, bad workrate and really dumb."
429,absolutely incredible player who then downed tools for years and has dodgy political views and affiliations
430,"didn't know about it too, saw him talking shit about Zinchenko the other day, guy is hella vocal about politics it usually come with a lot of hate"
431,Supported a man that people really didn't like much
432,He is just a scumbag
433,"1. Accused of being lazy 
2. Made a post calling out China for their treatment of the local Muslim population. Arsenal didn’t have his back and the fans called him “political” 
3. Open “support” of Erdogan. 
4. Accused the DFB of Islamophobia 
5. Refused to cut his wages during the pandemic 

I like Ozil and think that some of these accusations lack context and are circunstancial at best. Football Iconic made a really great video about Ozil that I highly recommend

https://youtu.be/8dIQ56YACvE?si=fgADRHdiCkqG387P"
434,"Supported a dictator. Called him “My President”.

He wasn’t really a revolutionary player. A classic playmaker that lacked consistency to be considered one of the true greats."
435,He's the antisemitic bream.
436,"He acted like a man child at Arsenal aswell. Managed to turn the narrative on his side that the only issue Arsenal had with him is the Uighur stuff. That was a shit move from our club but he had massive issues here prior. He was a big reason Emery got sacked because Emery hated his attitude and began benching him, but Ozil turned the squad against him instead.

Freddie also openly criticised him and Arteta also became fed up with his attitude in the end and finally cast him out. He sat on a monstrous contract he wasn’t justifying and was a big part of our shit locker room mentality but he always had god tier PR that made him look the victim no matter what."
437,Nice guy until he posed with Erdoghan and turned fascist
438,Outwardly support an absolute right wing nut job politician.
439,"I mean, he's a hypocrite. You play for the German national team and then after you are out of favour you turn out to be a Turkish nationalist? So far that you get a gray wolves tattoo.

Only ultra nationalists and some fenerbahce fans are buying that tbh."
440,Got a tattoo of a facist organisation
441,His political ideology doesn’t align with the Westerners.
442,I remember when Germany played against turkey on a Wednesday. He was injured allegedly. But then at the next Saturday he played again for Real Madrid. He is the most opportunistic player ever.
443,"People don’t like him because of his political opinions as they act like they’re experts in Turkish politics. 

As a player I can agree people would consider his mentality weak or unprofessional"
444,"Political matters. Had a picture with the Turkish president 2 months before the 2018 World Cup , where Germany as a whole messed up the entire tournament , and got blamed for the disaster. Then expressed his support to Uyghur Turks which leaves Chinese under blame , who had a huge chunk of stocks at Arsenal, which ruined it entirely for him"
445,Openly supporting any right-wing politician = cancelled. That’s all you need to know.
446,"He was honest about his political beliefs unlike almost every other footballer and got hatred for not apologising like Gundo did. 

He also had a ‘lazy’ play style that is a lightning rod for criticism unless you’re winning every game."
447,"Had a close relationship with Turkish president (dictator) Erdoğan, supported a far right Turkish terrorist group, acted like a Turkish nationalist but refused to join Turkish National team and he lied about it saying he wasnt invited to the Turkish National team, also accused his german teammates of racism, when he arrived at Turkey he was really underwhelming at Fenerbahçe then ended his career at Istanbul Başakşehir (A team that is owned by president Erdoğan and his far right buddies)"
448,Because he supports a boarderline terrorist.
449,Never moved faster than a light jog and couldn't tackle
450,The moment he showed his Muslim identity he became public enemy for the bigots and Islamophobes. Including Arsenal reprimanding him for speaking out against the plight of the Uighurs at the hands of the Chinese government.
451,He advocated for muslims in Uyghur. And you know how the prem is. If you support a blue eyed and blond haired human being you’re good but how dare you support a muslim terrorist right?
452,"In terms of being underrated on the pitch, just his casual and undemonstrative body language. Everything was so elegant he made it look simple and easy, whereas someone like Connor Gallagher steams around crashing into people and cant pass it ten yards but is lauded as a team player.

In terms of hatred almost certainly rooted in Racism and Islamaphobia. He famoulsy said when i win Im German when i lose im Turkish. He called out the inhumane treatment or Uighur Mulsims in China when Arsenal did a promotional tour there which was the end of that relationship.

He is a great footballer and human, among the most philanthropic out there."
453,Germans are S tier racists and don't consider anyone who is not white as germans. They have learnt to hide their true self but sometimes they show their true colours.
454,I mean Germany does have a history of racism and discrimination.
455,"he didnt had the mental capacity to overcome racist slurs he was facing. dunno why he didnt turn to some professional support etc. to overcome it and then had some faux pas like the erdogan pic for what he got critics but combined with the racial/german turkophobia it was a grossly exaggerated reaction from german medias/germany overall. now they had a reason to be dismissive and hateful. it was justified now and didnt need any implications or between the lines to slur him. and imo he lost the overview and instead on focusing what he had he tried to compensate it with turkeypholia aka ""now more than ever"" because his homeland kinda didnt feel home-ish. latest downfall is his grey wolf tattoo. they are a turkish right-wing extremist movement. he is a grown man and is responsible for it by himself. but imo it is pretty sure that the systematic german turkophoby gave him the kick in that direction. ""OG germans dont like it when (turkish) migrants sit at the same table with them. they are used migrants/deutschtürken stay on the floor"" is what a migration researcher once said. now obviously there is (more) change but during özil s rise it was more than ever present. it was that generation that didnt depend/want depend/needed to depend on low income jobs like their parents/grandparents. gündogan is an example that overcame that system. i am more than sure he had to suck up a lot of german bullshit in order to stay where he is now. özil on the other hand is now just a shallow shell of turkish propaganda. That's there so low profile germany football ""analysts"" can dismisse his past influence and success.
to say how exagerated german media was on özil. neuer once sang a croatian nazi song during his croatia holiday. 0 consequences or public apologies. gundogan didnt only apologize he had to openly prove ""his loyalty to germany"". özil didnt want to bow too low and tried to explain it."
456,"People are soft and dont really understand people nor politics, easily triggered, misinformed etc.. also not to mention the whole turks in germany situation, incompatible cultures and all that. It really doesnt matter, Ozil is one of the most attractive mids that ever played, i enjoyed every minute of his field time. Long live Ozil!"
457,He spoke facts.
458,He called out China for the uigher issue..China buys and sponsors alot of arsenals stuff.
459,"Being lazy on the pitch. And it’s not a myth either. There are numerous examples from highlights alone where you can pin at least a portion of the blame on Ozil for not bothering to track back or just dangling out a lazy leg. 

The Bayern thrashings were the perfect example of this. One or two goals where he lets Robben come inside, drift past him, then just jogs back at a snail’s pace."
460,He reminds me of Berbatov.  Amazing skills but seemingly no effort.  Some of his assists were crazy good.
461,"Yeah he wasn't the most professional, plus he's been controversial on his political views. It's a shame, because talent-wise he's definitely one of my favorite players. I don't care much for Real Madrid but I got an Özil jersey just because I was fascinated with him."
462,I felt he was very lazy.
463,"As a player from my understanding, his downfall at Arsenal was people wanted him to track back but he never did that in Germany or Madrid. 

People dislike his politics"
464,It was so disappointing
465,[deleted]
466,Nobody hates him all at all. Calling out an over rated player is not hate
467,"I understand people may not like him as a person but just like with actors I kinda like to stick to what they do as a professional, he's a football player you either like him on the pitch or you don't  


Idc who their best friends are or their political opinions"
468,"Man just stopped playing football at a semi-decent level... He could've done so much more but wasted his time and picked up his wages... Him and Hazard... Both were EXCELLENT players, don't get it twisted... Could say the same for Bale... Just coasting, picking up money and offering very little"
469,he preferred to act like a German during his early career and prime time and then decided to act like a Turkish when he got old/ his career started to decline. This is because he knew that he would benefit from being German in his very first years (German national team is far superior)  and then he was acting like he rememberred who he actually was.
470,"I think you should look up the definition of revolutionary.  He was good at his best, but he didn't change the way the game was played."
471,"A superb athlete loses all motivation upon achieving quite a lot to be fair. Mou read it early enough to boot him to Arsenal where he somewhat revitalized his ambition but petered out quickly. Also, his nonchalant body language was viewed by fans as a sign of not caring enough for the game and the team. Similarly, Berbatov and Arshavin were hated for their ""laziness"". But there is a room for players with this approach to the game and it is exactly why they find time and space to find that killer pass or a flick of a ball to leave the opponents frozen. On top of that you have your political and societal bullshit that only takes away from athletes than anything else."
472,That stupid Axel F song.
473,His entire career was based on a four week decent bit of form at the world cup
474,Well it’s more the fact he exists really
475,"He’s conservative and a nationalist, something Reddit user do not like."
476,"Sorry can somone

Explain precisely what the grey wolves are.

Confirm that the tattoo is specificly endorsing the grey wolve cause

Or have any documented evidence of Ozil endorsing fascist or right ing ideology."
477,"Was a solid human being and muslim
People hate that"
478,"“Revolutionary”? Not really, zero teams came knocking for him. Zero."
479,"Ozil posed for a picture with the Erdogan that was captioned MY PRESIDENT, as you know, Erdogan is Turkish. Then, QA he called out the Chinese government for the genocide of the Ughur Muslim minority, which caused China to pressure Adidas into dropping him and letting it be known that no matches featuring him would ever be shown in China....."
480,You mean aside from being the single laziest defensive player in the modern era (and that’s including MLS Messi) AND supporting a fascist???  Other than that I can’t really think of anything.
481,"He has some views that the Western world dont agree with and people have since used those to justify hate and amplify his other apparent flaws. 

Its certainly overblown and a lot of other players are free from criticism for similar views/actions with their nation & heritage. Being nationalistic and right wing isnt something unique to Ozil - many footballers are but none get the hate like Ozil.

Shitting on Muslims is trendy and closet Islamaphobia probably play a part too."
482,Overrated player for a guy who couldn't score goals or defend.
483,Lack speed.
484,"Stupid people will always look for reason to hate on someone. Ozil is a footballer and a fantastic one, and football is the only thing that matters. Everything else is just celebrity gossiping."
485,Played for arsenal
486,"1. Received German hate for taking Pic and supporting Erdogan
2. Received hate from China for supporting Uyghur Muslims. Arsenal had to sideline him fearing they would lose the Chinese fans and their market in the future"
487,His eyes were offside
488,"Grew up in Germany, profited off the German system, became rich in Germany. 

Continued by supporting a dictator who at the time (and still) was very, very anti-Germany, calling us Nazis for not allowing him to do his election campaign in Germany. 

Did not apologize for basically calling a foreign president ""his president"", a man who hates Germans. Instead, Ozil said that everyone was racist and islamophobic. 

Then, he got the tattoo of a fascist organization (which is against Jews and also Christianity, something not really popular here anymore).

Lastly, he still only holds the German passport while living in Turkey, acting Turkish. 

Just a hypocrite, a racist, and a stupid person overall."
489,He played for arsenal
490,"Fascist supporter, like Neymar."
491,He spoke against china's policy on the uyghurs
492,turky stuff
493,"Lives as free and secular as possible, supports radical Islamists in Turkey."
494,"Özil was a slightly frustrating player to watch. I thought Arsenal fans were too harsh on his performances, but I do understand the frustration. He looked like he wasn't trying, he calmly walked up to the ball and tried a little flick. The brilliance of him doing this was that, at least sometimes, he would look bored and not interested as he played a perfect 25 yard pass. By only looking at Özil, it would be impossible to predict what he was about to do."
495,Gargled Erdogans nutsack
