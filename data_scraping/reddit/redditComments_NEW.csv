7 - 1 - Most embarrassing semi, since I went to see Brokeback mountain with my dad at the pictures.;;reddit
7-0 score, I'm a german, but at this point I want brazil to shoot a few goals. You just don't beat someone to a pulp like that, not on live tv.;;reddit

Well won by Italy. Congrats.;;reddit
I only get into football in major tournaments so I know my level of patriotism is probably insultingly low for some people but, as an Englishman, bloody hell this was fun to watch.

"Not the most entertaining game, but the best team on the day won.  
Italian's were more creative, England had great spells, but resorted to long ball football for much of the 2nd half.   
Nobody disgraced themselves.

England in control at the moment. Going to be dangerous now with Grealish out there. Hopefully Italy can steady things a bit and wrestle control back.;;reddit

Incredibly close match and incredibly well played by both teams, was routing for England but GG Italy you played well.;;reddit

Seriously, this was a great game! So much better than the Copa final. GG Italy, and GG England. Italy was slightly better, so the result was accurate, despite the dramatic fashion;;reddit
Well done Italy deserved on balance but England played well and could’ve gone either way. Fans were better today and regardless of the moron mentality of some England fans our team culture has been excellent throughout the tournament.;;reddit

"England goal keeper. 100% commitment on that shot. 

He was hugging that as Italian ran up to kick. That was a solid save. Kick to head at that momentum would of been nasty.";;reddit

Did I just hear them booing the Italian anthem?;;reddit
Dang, Italy plays rough this game. Holy;;reddit
Donnarumma and Pickford are both beasts, but I am glad that Italy won in the end to be honest;;reddit
Maguire, pickford, and kane played well. Grealish came on late, and tried, but couldn't do much. Italy played an even better game though, and seeing their roughness, compared to England's flopping about like fish, was funny. Obviously, italy wasn't perfect on that: they took a few dives. But england was worse I think;;reddit

I have said it before but we really have lost our defensive identity. Everyone can score against us and most teams can score multiple times and they all know it. We surely have a quality problem, players like Lahm and Boateng have stabilized our defense for years but we also try to many different setups with coaching decisions which are weird at least.;;reddit
not so bad for an away game for germany;;reddit

Still think that the lack of a proper 6 is the main reason for our defensive issues. Henrichs-Tah-Rüdiger ain't that bad but they can't do shit when the midfield is basically non existent whenever the opponent wins the ball and just runs or passes through/over the midfield with no pressure. One of Kimmich or Gündogan has to be sacrificed for a 6 who may not be as good on the ball as them but atleast offers some defensive stability.;;reddit
abdülkerim will probably make a transfer. first the united game and now this game. bro’s on fire;;reddit

"These comments from all sides are hilarious lmfao, fun game for sure.

Honestly , if Bagelsmann just plays a 6, things would be much much better.

Why do we need Kimmich-Gundo-Wirtz as creators? That's more than enough, one must be replaced. Some teams even play with just a 10 and 2 defensive midfielders.";;reddit

"Tough loss, albeit by way of a stupid pen.

Havertz at LB was actually really good, I can see him work well there with some more experience as he got caught out of position a few times which is expected for your first ever match there.

Encouraging performance still imo";;reddit
Germany losing is always a good time, even if its just a friendly.;;reddit
I love how everyone tries to find a position that Havertz is good and still fails lol;;reddit

"If Wales can get to second in the group they’ve actually got a really decent run for the next few games. Really difficult to say who’s gonna do best against Italy between Wales and Switzerland though, but if Italy win tonight I would expect them to rest players against Wales so that might end up favouring the Welsh.

Also wouldn’t be surprised if Turkey totally fall apart against the Swiss.";;reddit

Soyuncu the only player who can actually defend today for turkey;;reddit

I don't care what people say, bale is a roll royce of a player, even after that missed pen;;reddit

Thought Morrell was great and Roberts deserved his goal, whilst other players were out on their feet he was a complete workhorse";;reddit
Icing on the cake that goal for Roberts, he was fucking sensational throughout.;;reddit
Those four cards in the end saved my bet lmao;;reddit
What a banger of a game. Enjoy Wales fans!;;reddit
My congratulations to Wales from Kurdistan;;reddit
Yes, Turkey was poor, but I want to talk about one of the unnoticed players of the day: Joe Morrell. I watch a decent amount of football, and had never heard of the guy, but he had a good game. He seemed to be everywhere, just like Ramsey.;;reddit
Wales vs Italy is gonna be a spicy one.;;reddit
Ramsey MOTM?;;reddit

I honestly thought everything in football had been tried out by now. But no... Gareth Bale apparently waits till the Euros before inventing a new type of corner kick. One that's so devastating he can get away with it twice on the run.;;reddit

Fuckin hell boys that was a bit special wasn’t it?! Cymru am byth!;;reddit
My call of Wales winning the Euros inches ever so closer to fruition;;reddit
I liked Savage on commentary;;reddit
Turkey's defence was genuinely terrible. Don't know what the commentator was talking about praising Soyuncu towards the end, maybe it was one of the only players they know? While Wales were running at them, they just backed off, committed cynical fouls and allowed Wales to walk right through them. Last couple of minutes was a joke from them too;;reddit
It’s the history of the ottoman;;reddit

Croatia's president is so touchy. I like that.;;reddit

KARIUS RETURNS FROM THE GRAVE ;;reddit
I will have nightmares of that first half but France did better in the second, they executed their game plan to perfection, we just couldn't break them down. Congratulations are in order, I still can't believe I saw Croatia dominating a world-class opponent in a fucking World Cup final.;;reddit
Alexi Lalas just said the Griezmann dive was a foul and that “there doesn’t have to be contact for it to be a foul”. God I’m ashamed to be American whenever he opens his mouth. ;;reddit
Croatia’s dominating. Except the score.;;reddit
France won the world cup but Croatia won the hearts of the world. Croatia, keep your heads high, that was a phenomenal effort. Modric, you're  a gem! ❤;;reddit
Fortnite celebration should be instant disqualification from World Cup;;reddit
Hmmm that dive though ;;reddit
that already leaves a bad after taste and the match is so young;;reddit
It’s far from over, Croatia has been threatening the entire time, France looks like the worse team so far and got bailed out by the dive;;reddit
France already crying about calls after being gifted a goal ;;reddit

"My mom just asked, ""So they have to take the penalty from the spot in the box where the handball was?"" 

She's seen 250+ soccer games in her life.";;reddit
Croatia clearly better side in the 1st half. Quite a bit unlucky tho;;reddit
Really entertaining first half, though I feel like 3 minutes of stoppage wasn't nearly enough when you factor in the replay ;;reddit
France is playing pretty disappointing tbh;;reddit
Did Lalas just say there doesn't need to be contact to be a foul?;;reddit
This sums up this World Cup perfectly. An own goal, a set piece and a VAR penalty. Classic ;;reddit
What kind of shit show is this ;;reddit
Love how they didn't even try to show the dumb ass intruder so they didn't get the attention they wanted.;;reddit
There are hundreds of yellow shirts lining the field.  How does that happen?!;;reddit
France was so good defensively against Belgium, now they're giving away chances left and right. Croatia unlucky not to have equalized yet. ;;reddit
Pogba with a terrific pass then finish;;reddit
What is Subasic doing?;;reddit
All the extra minutes catching up to Croatia now.  Referring decisions haven’t helped them, but those are some tired men.;;reddit
This is the first time I've seen Croatia shook this tournament. ;;reddit
hahah now this is a shitshow;;reddit
Wtf is this game?;;reddit
Wtf this game is insane ;;reddit

Smh at all these racists saying that the French team is just Africans. Majority of these “African” players were born in France and without French youth development they wouldn’t be the players they are today. They are French no matter their ethnicity. ;;reddit
That  take the L celebration wont sit well ITT lol;;reddit
Stoppage time is football’s biggest downfall. Why not just pause the fucking clock when shits going on. No one wonder players waste so much time rolling and diving and arguing, they’re basically incentivized to do so. They know the amount of stoppage time added on will never be as much as the time that was actually wasted. ;;reddit
Croatia definitely the better team. France ahead with two lucky chances. As long as Croatia hold up at the back, I see them tying the game at least in the second half. ;;reddit
Feels weird to see a tottenham player lift a trophy. ;;reddit
What is the point of VAR if they can't use it to tell the referee if the player is diving.;;reddit

Germany is a democracy and Iran is what it is 🤔🤔🤔;;reddit
Iranians are such informed people, NOT.;;reddit
In our defense, about 90% of them didn't know what it actually meant, & they thought it's just the general military salute in Germany, we we're trying to show respect & love towards the German team, but we fucked up gloriously!;;reddit
There were 100 thousands people in the stadium, find the extended footage & see how many did the salute... besides, it wasn't thought thoroughly in our schools since the holocaust denial was part of Islamic republic policy, so people had to search & study it on their own;;reddit
Isn't that how shit talking about works? lol;;reddit

If they were meaning to piss germany off they did it, if not... wtf was going threw ya alls heads;;reddit

Germans and Iranians and Saudis should all be ashamed for their countries’ horrible behavior towards Jews and Israel.

Man I only had two African players once both my central midfielders. It felt like they were gone half the season;;reddit
Yeah man that really sucks! And it's always when there's crazy fixture congestions because of the last few UCL league stage matches.;;reddit
i have 8 african players in my squad. 8. and 4 of them are regular starters. lost 1st place in the league during that time and never got it back. yeah, i feel you.;;reddit
Me with my Japanese development centre overseas and when the Asian cup roles around, the youth gets a chance to step up;;reddit

Also, avoid West and North Africa like the plague.";;reddit
Only good thing about having the long winter break in Denmark… never lose African players;;reddit
[removed];;reddit
Yea I refuse to sign African players because of this;;reddit
Shit, I regret signing Zambo Anguissa now;;reddit
My south korean striker i used for easier matches and fixture congestion felt like he was gone for about 3.5 months during international duty. form hasn't returned since then and we've toyed with a new tactic where he goes from being in a rotated selection of 2 center forwards to being the 3rd or 4th choice in a lone strike position. tough;;reddit
Yeah AFCON is the reason I have avoided signing Onana on FM22. He is always available as a free transfer but being without my first-choice keeper for a month seems like a nightmare.;;reddit
both my rightbacks are off to Afcon so I just switch to a 3atb for a month, at least Mazraoui won it last time he went, Lamptey didn't;;reddit
Why bother with African players at this point really lol...;;reddit
I mean sure, AFCON is very inconvenient for teams with important African based players, but you did this to yourself when you created that super team of players you knew were probably going to that tournament when it rolled round.;;reddit
When I sign French players but they take up African nation's call ups. I am looking at you Dagba.;;reddit

Great counter for nothing. Truly amazing.;;reddit

"Hojlund is **suffering** with our selfish wingers.

Might not have been the expected thing to do, but when Garnacho takes the touch that he scuffs he should have either shot or rolled it gently to his left. Hojlund would have had basically the whole net to shoot at. 

When he gets some cohesion with our other attackers he'll start banging them in";;reddit

You would think the Argentinian would finish that.;;reddit
Why don't we do this more often? I've noticed this season where we seem to always slow down the play after set pieces and corners, which we should instead use to counter attack our opponents.;;reddit
My first instincts say offside but I think he was barely on. Should've squared it for the finish.;;reddit
Only good highlights are in his hair.;;reddit
It's hard not to compare this Garnacho attempt with Martinelli's similar goal yesterday. One looked completely in control of the situation (and ball) and one didn't.;;reddit
I'll watch any game if Miguel Simón is narrating.;;reddit
Dribbles right to the goalie.  Great job bloke.;;reddit

So glad our coach played Gavi every single game to ensure we qualified in 1st just to have the privilege of having a harder group than Scotland;;reddit
Holy shit Albania we really got the hardest group;;reddit
Why are the Belgians ALWAYS lucky with their draws. Sincerely, a jealous neighbour from the north.;;reddit
Why do we almost every time land in a group of death god damn;;reddit
Very hard draw for Albania. Every goal they score will be a big success in a group like that. The group B is the group of death. Groups E and F are the weakest on paper. Portugal and Belgium are the clear favorites in these groups. Opening match Germany vs Scotland will be a fun match. Fans from both nations make a great atmosphere.;;reddit

Drawing England unfortunately just means the youtube “analysts” will give us plenty of air time..;;reddit
Collective sigh of relief after Italy was chosen for Group B, UEFA really didn't want to set off another Balkan conflict with Serbia in pot 4.;;reddit

If Scotland manage to get through the groups for once and Croatia finish 2nd in group B it'll be a rerun of Scotland/Croatia from 2021.";;reddit
Group A looks like fun. Group B biggest group of death. Underrated one is probably going to be Group E;;reddit

group b is a bit insane;;reddit
Shit;;reddit
That's a decent group for us. No reason why we can't get 7 points at least. To be fair though, getting out of the group has never really been an issue for us (Brazil 2014 notwithstanding). If I have it right, we could theoretically play Wales in the Ro16 and Scotland in the quarters, which would be fun! Though that'd require the Scots getting out of the group for the first time in their history...;;reddit

If we make it past Kazakhstan and Georgia/Luxembourg, we definitely have hopes to make the Round of 16 too.

Belgium's group is ridiculously easy. Ukraine (they will be the Play Off B team) must be happy as well with that draw.

Kinda speaks for the belief in our team that I‘m not shocked we drew France and the Netherlands. Yeah we‘re underdogs but there is a chance to grab second place. I‘d personally love to get Wales into the group, would be fun to get some revenge for the WC playoff, without Bale smashing in freekicks for them.;;reddit

Watching the press conference right now, and watching Xabi speak has convinced me that he is levels above Tuchel. He truly respects his players and gives anyone an opportunity if they fight for it. This team under Tuchel has zero passion and he is yapping about training and talking about individual mistakes ruining the game smh;;reddit
Fuck Tuchel and fuck every player who's putting in a mediocre performance;;reddit
Flick suicide ball was still better than whatever the fuck we did in this match. Crazy how we had 1 shot on target in the entire match.;;reddit
What a boring fucking game. The entire season has been filled with these. Its like our team doesn't know how to attack. Its no longer enjoyable to watch them play. I watched an old game recently and I just wish that team was here to play today.;;reddit
At this point Tuchel has shown that with Bayern, he has no world class pedigree - fire him. The board should try to limit the damage as much as possible. Our standards are too high;;reddit

Leverkusen wanted it a lot more.  They deserved this.  They have that team of destiny look this year.   Good for them.   They won’t keep that team together for too long;;reddit

Holy mother of god WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?;;reddit
Probably the most inferior Bayern team i’ve seen ever play. Disgraceful with such a stacked line-up.;;reddit
Players are bad, we have an obvious lack of quality in some positions. Some players have zero passion and look like they barely care. But the biggest problem now is Tuchel with no competition, just fire him. Players can be evaluated again in June, but I can't take this fraud ball anymore;;reddit
How we had players like Sane and Goretzka played for the majority of the game baffles me. Such a disappointing performance from the team.;;reddit
"I did start saying, sack Tuchel after the first match against Copenhagen. Got downvoted by those ""Tuchel's supporters"" without seeing the problems we are facing. We got no improvement and even downgraded from then. But now, I changed my mind. He should have stayed until end of the season for defending the reputation of other coaches. No one is gonna share the stain of losing the Bundesliga title by coaching modern Bayern. Fuck you, Tuchel.";;reddit

"How can you look at the first half at halftime and think ""alrighty, let's continue just like that?""
the 3 atb did not work at all with Leverkusen's pressing, they did not even have to move around much, Tella, Wirtz and Adli against our CBs, Xhaka and Andrich against Pavlovic and Goretzka. Only option was to pass the ball to Boey or Mazraoui which both then had no chance against Stanisic and Grimaldo.
Wtf was that plan?";;reddit
Gotta give it to Leverkusen. Not a moment where you felt that they weren't in total control of the game. This isn't a fluke, Alonso is turning out to be one of the great coaches.;;reddit
![gif](giphy|GAzaXWl5r9bFOAOyR0|downsized);;reddit
What happened to us after December break ? I know we were not solid  every game but Kane, Sane and Tel were a danger to the opposition every time they had the ball. Nowadays Kane is invisible on the pitch, Sane can’t pass nor finish and Tel is hesitant on the ball. Tuchel was never a match for Bayern but this is beyond him.;;reddit

Where are all the tuchel apologists now? I have said this from day one, when it comes to actually good teams we are LEVELS behind. I honestly wouldn't be shocked if we didn't manage to get past Lazio as well. Such a disgrace. I thought last season would be our disaster and we would come back strong, but this, this is horrible.;;reddit
Whatever happens - CL win or not, title win or not, we need to completely tear apart this team, and rebuild from the ground up. At least the 2011/12 team fought, and FOUGHT hard, but this? This is a disgrace. Many of the players who now wear the crest - they should never have had it in the first place.;;reddit

I wish we could bring back JN somehow. It's like there's something cancerous with the core of this team and I don't know what it is. Half the time it looks like we aren't even trying.;;reddit
"Embarrassing performance yet again. Given how much better our squad is than any other in the league, we should not be playing this poorly over and over and over. 

Tuchel is not worth keeping until the end of the season, let alone until the end of the day. Criminally mismanaging the riches he has access to. 

ONE SHOT RECORDED. Jesus fucking Christ. 

I hope that last goal buries Tuchel.";;reddit

Probably a mixture of factors. 1) our media is particularly bad for overhyping our players which probably annoys other nations. 2) people find our ‘it’s coming home’ and other assorted songs to be annoying. 3) we’re talked about amongst the top nations despite having won nothing since the 60s. 4) (and this is probably not fourth in importance) we colonised half the planet which has left an (understandable) bitter taste in the mouth of many.;;reddit

Well, they did used to own a quarter of the world. And they probably been to war with about half of the world in total.;;reddit
Hate is strong I don't hate them;;reddit
"Brazilian here... 

Even though you are right about the colonizer past of England, what annoys me about them is that they overhype any average player they got like Grealish or Sterling.

From the European National Teams, France is the most hated over here (98 and 06 haha).

We dislike Germany and Italy too, but 
we respect them more as our rivals.";;reddit
No one likes us, we dont care.;;reddit
99% of English people I’ve met are absolutely rock solid. The colonialism would be easy to look past. Then their media steps in…;;reddit
"It don't matter if English never qualified again for WC EU's  
They would still get the hate even the woman's team getting hate now since they could win WC on sun";;reddit
Honestly I think other countries just like to hate England for historical reasons, which is fair I suppose, but I really hate when you see significantly worse behaviour from European hooligans in France, Italy, Holland, and there seems to be much less negative views on them;;reddit
They hate us coz they aint us;;reddit
Contrary to other comments, i believe a lot of the hate comes from english folk themselves. They care so much about their domestic league that some of the passion is lost for their national team;;reddit
For me, it's because if you added up their individual fifa scores, you'd probably have the best team in the world. And then you watch them pass backwards for 90 minutes and wonder wtf happened;;reddit
"Salty crybabies that can't handle the English fans having a bit of fun singing it's coming home.

And those that think England is uniquely racist because of a couple bellends on twitter after the euros final.";;reddit
I think they hate the English national team fans more than the team itself.;;reddit
I don't mind people hating the NT but if you support an English club and hate the national side your opinion on anything doesn't count. No one stormed the beaches at Normandy in a Bayern Munich shirt.;;reddit
Because it’s the popular thing to do and people can’t think for themselves;;reddit
Two words: English Fans;;reddit
Im Irish so....;;reddit
"Huge amounts of Europe are xenophobic, especially towards English people, so it gets them a chance to be xenophobes.  They then make up some BS excuses to justify being bigots.

Doesn't just happen in football happens in Boxing and F1 too, particularly towards black Brits.  I wonder why?";;reddit
[deleted];;reddit
"It's mostly the media I guess. English is a universal language. People all over the world consume their media more than other teams. As a Spanish person, you wouldn't know how the French, German or Italian media are hyping up their own NT.

Also because they haven't won anything in a long time, it becomes increasingly funny when they crash out of another International tournament despite all the hype.";;reddit
"

Colonial baggage.

Most of the countries still haven't recovered";;reddit
"Northern Irish, I for one don't dislike the England team, I'm happy they do well, it's the newspapers and dicky commentators that just over hype you... They're the ones I can't listen too. 
Mates are English, and they're OK with me. 
I'm not rushing out to buy an England shirt though 😂";;reddit
As a Scotsman, having to listen to the UK media salivate over the England NT and constantly bringing up 1966 provides me with enough reason to enjoy seeing them lose. Bitter? You bet!;;reddit
"I hate the English men's team with all my heart ❤️

And, it's mostly because of their media and the fans than the team by itself.";;reddit
Who gives a fuck? If people want to lose their heads over us that’s their business. Probably better to be hated than to be forgotten anyway. Don’t be such a melt, OP. It’s unbecoming.;;reddit
I think it's not again the NT itself but more against their fans who genuinely believe they are a historic top 5 NT when in all their history their biggest achievement is a WC won with a goal that didn't enter the net;;reddit
Hate us because they ain’t us.;;reddit
I am simply very anglophobic, I wish nothing but misfortune for Perfidious Albion and its awful food for all eternity;;reddit
Imperialism;;reddit
It has everything to do with the fans and nothing to do with the team itself;;reddit
England have one of the most likeable teams, people like to seem them lose because many of their fans are scum. For example, the racist abuse hurled at Saka, Rashford, and Sancho following the Euro 2020 final.;;reddit
"The deluded media and fans.
As a Swede, I always had England as my “second team”, that is, until I moved to the UK and realised just how insufferable the media and some fans were.";;reddit
"I mean i just feel like they are boring
Like sure they invented the sport but they are so arrogant about it that i just dislike them";;reddit
Hating the English national team has been the easiest, most natural thing I've experienced in life. It could not be any easier.;;reddit
There’s the obvious point that many countries around the world hate England for historical/geopolitical reasons. But I think the number one reason is that their fans are incredibly toxic and obnoxious.;;reddit
"Because every time they beat Macedonia in a friendly, 'Football's coming home' .

As an Irish man, we have our history as well. 

If the media didn't hype them up so much, it might be a different story. (Highly doubt it)";;reddit
Because they are the most boring team to watch?;;reddit
England is like the America of football. They think they are amazing because they never look at anyone else and dont realise how far behind they are so then when the conversation starts its awkward to tiptoe around their feelings.;;reddit
We just get too excited, it’s the same with Liverpool highest highs and lowest lows and as a neutral it’s kind of enjoyable;;reddit
Colonisation;;reddit
[deleted];;reddit
It's the fans, I'm english and even I know we are a bunch of loud unapologetic aholes. Damnit, we still haven't let the hand of god go even though he has passed;;reddit

Was probably a Liverpool supporter....;;reddit
When Hungary played against England in Wolverhampton, all the fans whisted and they sang an other song while the hungarian anthem. Then we beat them 0-4;;reddit
"Crap kits. 

They always look like a bunch of scruffs.";;reddit
It's filled with Englishmen;;reddit
I never really got it until this women's world cup when I went to a couple England games and sat with their supporters.....now I get it.;;reddit
[removed];;reddit
People just hate us. You learn to embrace it as the years fly by. We are cunts, to be fair.;;reddit
It’s not your team people despise… they’re fans of the players they see in the Premier League. It’s the fans, the media, the arrogance without winning anything and having the best chances and also historical reasons. Maradona’s game against England (yes, _that one_ was happening during the era of the Malvines to give you an example.;;reddit
It’s not just football. People genuinely don’t like the English. We are a tiny island that has been at the forefront of invention and technology for hundreds of years. We have history that goes back    Over two thousand years and we have invaded and colonised hundreds of countries throughout history. I think the hatred/dislike goes a little bit deeper than football.;;reddit
Because fuck England.;;reddit
[removed];;reddit
Punishment for having the last empire on earth;;reddit
Bood the Hungarian anthem got fucked 4-0 great all around;;reddit
As this was Zidane's last ever game he ended up doing voluntary work with kids in football as a form of community service because his 3 game ban was pretty meaningless;;reddit
"Materazzi was also given a two-match ban by FIFA. Materazzi said that when Zidane offered to give him his France jersey after the final whistle, in response to persistent shirt-tugging by the Italian, he replied: ""I would prefer your sister.""";;reddit
Pas ça Zinédine !;;reddit
The best header of all time;;reddit
This was 14 years ago;;reddit
You know you’re wrong when Gattuso has a reasonable reaction;;reddit
"As well as being one of the most surreal things I've ever seen on live TV, this headbutt introduced me to the word ""meme"". Even [Family Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYN54NZqlcw) had a take on it.";;reddit
The official somehow used VAR more effectively over a decade before it was implemented;;reddit
I still remember this as the first football meme to emerge on the internet. Even the YTMND that came out of it.;;reddit

"This would be Leicester winning the Prem levels of ""wtf is happening"" if this had happened in the era of social media.

The red card, and France's eventual loss, made me so sad as a 6 year old kid. First time I cried about a football game lol.";;reddit
You could say he retired with a bang;;reddit
Sotto la doccia, Sotto la doccia, Sotto la doccia, Sotto la doccia!!!;;reddit
I remember watching one of those early youtube video where there's funny edits of this foul like MK's fatality or Zidane's head exploding and I would laugh my ass off. I was 9.;;reddit
The worst part of this is that headbutt caused no damage at all. If you want to do this and get sent off, at least throw a haymaker or a studs up kick to the stomach. Do some damage FFS.;;reddit
SOTTO LA DOCCIA!;;reddit
"I only came in peace with this when we won a WC 12 years later (where Italy did not even qualify for).

Arguably the biggest foul in all of sports, next to Mike Tyson biting Holyfield in the ear.;;reddit
14 years later, this is still wonderful to watch.;;reddit
Serene watching this match live;;reddit
"This game was so dramatic

Zidanes penalty, the headbutt, penalty shootout... i really enjoyed this WC final.

Zidane has huge balls tho (no homo)... imagine pulling off the stuff he did, in a fucking WC final.";;reddit
Thanks for the world cup,bud;;reddit
"""The man who sent off Wayne Rooney.""

Fucking hell, english commentators really make everything about themselves.";;reddit
Bellissimo;;reddit
I remember when the Zidane headbutt flash game became really popular after that. Was a great game lol;;reddit
"Materazzi was the man of that match 100%.

He committed the penalty that ended as France's goal

He scores Italy's goal

He got France's MVP sent off 

He scored his penalty on the shoot out.

dude is a GOAT. had he just not taken the bait...;;reddit
This was legendary. After this, the word “Zidanata” was added to the Italian vocabulary, meaning giving a header.;;reddit
I'm still wondering to this day what he said to Zidane;;reddit
I was in France at the time and people weren't mad at the time, they were fucking howling with laughter. It was a different story after penalties of course but at the time he was seen as a fucking legend(at least at the viewing party in Marseilles) .;;reddit

Imagine if this happened today? 100k upvotes;;reddit
As an American soccer fan that watched this game in Italy surrounded by 100,000 fans, this moment will live on in my mind forever. Such a crazy event.;;reddit
Pretty much cost France the World Cup, as an Italian fan I thank him. Saw him in an elevator in Chicago a couple years ago, was so tempted to thank him for that, but then figured I might end up on the floor.;;reddit
Stop, I can only get so wet.;;reddit
Also, this was one of the first examples of VAR ever. The referee didn't see the headbutt, but the 4th man did and invited him to watch the replay on the stadium screens.;;reddit

Greatest header.;;reddit
I remember watching this. Italy really perfect the flop in this match. Zidane deserved the red, but no way he decleated that dude like that.  Can’t believe how long ago this was.;;reddit
It's odd to think so many younger fans are only seeing this for the first time possibly ir never really knew the whole backstory and what it meant at the time.;;reddit
Can't believe this was 14 years ago. I remember watching this live;;reddit
Still the stupidest thing I have ever seen a footballer do.;;reddit
Fuck Materazzi;;reddit
I didn't get it then, I don't get it now- why headbutt someone's chest? That's just a bit weird, isn't it?;;reddit
Coup de front a la zizou! Mythique une légende !;;reddit
Part of the reason I bought a Zizou jersey... which i am incidentally wearing at the moment.;;reddit
Stuff of legends;;reddit
I fucking hated this World Cup. If I remember correctly, Italy cheated to win against Australia. Then this shit. Then I don’t even remember watching the final.;;reddit
"Dumbest move in the history of the World Cup. He threw away his country's chance of winning because Materazzi said something nasty about his sister.

And the weirdest thing is that the most of the French public were generally okay with what he did.

It boggles the mind!";;reddit
I saw this on TV and cried when I was a kid;;reddit
Probably my favorite thing i watched live, the other one was the Ronaldo people didn't like taking a free kick to the nuts twice in a game.;;reddit
I heard he cussed his mum;;reddit
He really doesn't get enough shit for that imo. If I was a French football fan, I would still be pissed for this stupidity.;;reddit
Love this. Cost France the World Cup and was the last game of his international career. Because someone goaded him on the field. What a chump.;;reddit
Dumbest thing he's ever done.. robbed himself and us of a great finish.;;reddit
I will love Zidane forever for this.;;reddit

Haha love this match. I don't know what's more embarrassing though, our NT's performance, or me as a drunk 15 year old absolutely loving it and hating everything Portugese for weeks. ;;reddit

i kind of feel ashamed but .... Best. Game. Ever ;;reddit
Somewhat surprising, in the build up towards the Holland-Portugal game of the EC 2012, the Holland journalists were referring to the Portuguese as aggressive and sneaky.  At least I, after this game and the world cup (final) in South-Africa, would call Holland the overly aggressive team.;;reddit
Man, almost forgot how fucking awesome this match were. I just love how Deco kills that Holland guy after they refuses to give Portugal the ball back at the fair-play situation. Thanks for the video OP.;;reddit
What do you want? Theres centuries of history and drama between us!;;reddit

One of the worst and most entertaining games I have ever watched.;;reddit

The ref went absolute bonkers on this one. One of the few matches I watched just for the ref and the fouls.;;reddit
Shhh this never happened. ;;reddit
I wish more games were like this. It's so much more entertaining. The only real rage I've seen this season was Simeone vs Varane, and that didn't really go anywhere;;reddit

"Costinha's second yellow is the dumbest red card I've ever seen. Intentional handsball on the middle line when you're already booked. 

Or maybe it's this one:

2:00, Guidetti takes his shirt off after scoring a penalty, getting him his second yellow";;reddit
Watching that game live as a neutral left me with a still-lingering distaste for both teams.  It seemed like every player left the pitch looking like a jerk to us neutrals.;;reddit
What is it with Holland and high fouls in WC same in the final against spain in 2010 god that was packed with them. ;;reddit
"Ah yes, the usual anti-CR7 tactic: ""we suck, let's break his legs.""

But hey, it's a contact sport.

Worse than the fouls was Holland's lack of fair-play. Instead of giving the ball back at one point after an injury against Portugal, they tried to attack an unsuspecting Portugal side. This resulted in 4 yellows, definitely the worse moment of this game.

But Holland lost, that was definitely the best part of the game. Eheheheheh.";;reddit
Came for the fouls. Stayed for that cunt Deco getting hurt. *cough* Celtic vs Porto UEFA Cup Final *cough*;;reddit
