Summer holiday for students normally starts in May and ends in August/September so it's not like the WC is interfering with school schedules.\\n\\nBut also the biggest thing that comes to mind is that 7 of the top 10 largest capacity stadiums in the World are College stadiums including Michigan's famous Big House ranking number 3. More seats means more ticket/merchandise sales. Why is FIFA of all people opting for smaller capacity stadiums when there is more money to be made. I understand that the cities probably playa big part of the decistion, but on the other side, why did the Americans decide not push hosting WC games into other lesser known cities in an attempt to boost the local economy and grow the game in lesser populated areas? It's not like it's 2016 situation where stadiums literally needed to be built, the infrastructure is already there.\\n\\nThese were just some of my thoughts the past few days but again maybe some of you fine people know something I don't.</td>\n",

Whenever I see a women's professional league post, there is at least one comment mentioning men. \\n\\nIt's a fact that women aren't as skilled as men regarding the sport due to biologic differences so why do some people feel the need to talk women's football down because they can't keep up with men's? Isn't this the reason they are separated?\\n\\nYou don't have to watch it but at least have some decency and respect the players that work hard to get better. \\n\\nJust a thought that's been bothering me.  \n",

I got to watch them train and after they were done I got to meet like half the team. They were all absolutely brilliant. Most of them were asking questions and genuinely taking an interest, particularly about Australia, they had like 100 questions about life here. Some even joked around and told me I have a funny accent when I speak Spanish, every single of of them took pictures with me. They were playing Boca juniors in like 4 days so I wished them luck.\\n\\nHave any of you ever met any footballers? What was your experience?  \n",

But after seeing all the stadiums being announced and where the final rounds will be played, I am curious as to why no University stadiums were chosen? Summer holiday for students normally starts in May and ends in August/September so it's not like the WC is interfering with school schedules.\\n\\nBut also the biggest thing that comes to mind is that 7 of the top 10 largest capacity stadiums in the World are College stadiums including Michigan's famous Big House ranking number 3. More seats means more ticket/merchandise sales. Why is FIFA of all people opting for smaller capacity stadiums when there is more money to be made. I understand that the cities probably playa big part of the decistion, but on the other side, why did the Americans decide not push hosting WC games into other lesser known cities in an attempt to boost the local economy and grow the game in lesser populated areas? It's not like it's 2016 situation where stadiums literally needed to be built, the infrastructure is already there.\\n\\nThese were just some of my thoughts the past few days but again maybe some of you fine people know something I don't.  \n",

And then Kim Kardashian and maybe one of her kids with some draw, bad lighting and sound.\\n\\nI was really worried that it's turning into a joke this \"thing called soccer\" for the Americans and the Canadians.\\n\\nThen I saw Infantino in a light pink suit and pink hoodie saying something about the final on his own instagram and gave up.\\n\\nI don't mean to offend anyone but this celebrity thing is just...and then Infantino..I mean.\\n\\nMaybe I'm just having a bad day lol\\n\\nWhy?
